deavour by all the meanes he could to deliver his brother from prison. The same
yeere, at the earnest request os some, the king held a parliament at winchester,
where, by procurement of the old queen and Roger Mortimer, the said earle os
Kent and many other noble men and religious persons, to wit, the provincials os
the white Carmelite fryers and os the blacke preaching friers, and frier Richard
Wilton, were accused of conspiracie, touching (as it was said) the deliverie os the
kings father: which matter although it were but devised santasie and a meere lye,
yet the said earle, sor certaine confessions which he made, and sor certaine letters
which were found about him, was there beheaded. The other, to wit, the provin-
cials os the Predicants and Carmelites, were banished: but the bishop os London
was set at libertie, Robert de Tauntone, priest, and some certaine Carmelite friers
and Predicants were condemned to perpetuall prison. The death of the said earle
was the lesse lamented‚ because his family and servants had above measure affiicted
the commons, in taking up things (as they travailed) at the king's price, paying
nothing or very little for it.'
