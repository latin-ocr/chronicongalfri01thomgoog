bowes, quarrels, armour and victualles. The king staying there two dayes, they
went to Gresile nigh unto Pountoys3 then to Autell. Τὴε next day they passed
by the citie os Wenneys, which they touched not; and so by Trosolours at the
water of Son'ie, where they lodged. The next day they wanne the towne os Poys,
and brent the castell. From thence they went to Aregnus3 then to Acheu‚ where
they lodged. The nexte day they came to Noell upon the sea side; the F rench
men of Dabvile and the countrey came to the soorde side to hinder their passage,
with whom the king had a sore conflict, but the enemies were put to the worse
and more then two thousand slaine, and the towne of Croytoy taken and brent,
and above three hundred Germaines slaine. The next day they followed the king
on the river os Some, and on the banks side (where the king with his hoste were
lodged) came traveling Philip de Valoys, the French king, with the kings os
Boheme and Malegre, leading an armie of men innumerable‚ divided into eight
great battelles. King Edward sent to the French king, offering him free passage
over the foorde, is he would come and choose a place apt to fight a field in 3 but
this Philip went to another place of passage. On the morrow king Edward
removed to Cresifield, where the armie of the F rench king met him. The king
therefore set his sonne the prince os Wales to governe the vaward3 the middle
warde the earle of Northampton3 the third he tooke to guide himselfe. The
armie of the Frenchmen were devided into nine troupes. The vaward was com-
mitted to the king os Boheme. The French king commaunded his banner called
Oiliflame to be set up, aster which time it was not lawfull under paine of death to take
any man to save his lise. [Side note .· The French banner of oiliflame signified no
mercy, more then fire in oile.] This banner, that it might differ from his standert,
had in it lillies of gold very broad. On the other side king Edward commanded
his banner to be erected of the dragon‚ which signified fiercenesse and cruelty to
be turned against the lillies. These armies being thus appointed stoode in the
fielde from one of the clocke untill the evening. About the sunne setting, after
the armies had justed, they beganne by the sound of the trumpets to give signe
of battaile, but they themselves felt the force of the English archers, and as sor
their quarrels, they fell short a great way. Moreover, their footemen, being placed
among their owne horsemen, were by them (when they were gauled with the
English shotte os arrowes) overrunne and troden upon, that a great outcry was
made, as it were to the starres, and the whole forme of the array was broken, and
they, fighting with the English armed men, are beaten downe with polaxes. ln
this so terrible a bickering the prince of WaleS, being then but sixeteenth yeeres
old, shewed his wonderfull towardnesse, laying on very hotely with speare and
shielde. This battell dured three partes of the night, in the which time the
F renchmen gave five great assaults against our men, but at the length they being
conquered ran away. On the morrow there came {oure armies os fresh souldiours
to the French side, and, making semblance as though their part had suffered no
hai-me, they came against the Englishmen and gave them a fresh battell. On the
other side, the Englishmen withstood them very stoutely, and, aster a sharpe con-
flict‚ they forced their foes to flie, and in chasing os them, together with them
