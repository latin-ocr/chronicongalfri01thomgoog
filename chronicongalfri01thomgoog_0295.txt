ΝΟ TES ΛΝΒ ILL USTRA TIONS. 249

Kildesby‚ the king’s clerk and keeper of the privy seal, was archbishop elect of
York in 1340, but was set aside in favour of William de la Zouch.

Pago 76, l. 18. Castra de Bruske et de Τ emplo Correntyn. Baker’s knowledge of the
campaign is evidently very confused. ‘Bruske’ is no doubt Brest. As to
‘Templum Correntyn,' there is a small place near Ploermel named Temple-
le-Carentoir‚ which may have been the scene of some skirmish or assault during
the war, perhaps after Edward lauded, when operations were carried on in that
direction.

Pago 77, 1. 7. Henn’cus comes Derbie, etc. He succeeded as earl of Lancaster, 22nd
Sept. 1345, and was created duke on the 6th March, 1352. Hugh Courtenay
succeeded as earl of Devon in 1341 ; died in 1377. Laurence de Hastings was
created earl of Pembroke, 12th Oct. 13393 died in 1348. Ralph de Stafford
succeeded as baron Stafford in 1308, and was created earl on the 5th March,
1351 3 died in 1372.

Baker is very confused as to the capture of the different places. Bergerac was
first taken on the 24th August, 1345 ; Aiguillon, early in December3 La Reole‚ in
January, 1346. The ‘villa sancti Johannis‚' Saint-Jean-d'Angely‚ was not taken
till September, 1346. Derby did not go near Toulouse, although it is not impos-
sible that some incursion was made thither. Baker says that he had his informa·
tion from persons who were besieged there; but he was quite capable of confusing
events, and he is most probably referring to the expedition of 1349. See p. 108,
l. 4, and the note on the same, p. 277.

—— 1. 24. Bernardo de LibretO. Bernard, sire d’Albret3 died 1358.

-- l. 30. Per armorum errancias. This seems to mean: by the procession of his
banner, on which the picture of the Virgin stood for his armorial device.

Pace 78, l. 7. Obsessi! villam de A guyloun. The siege began some time between
the 22nd March and the 15111 April, 1346 (Luce‘s Froissart‚ iii. p. xxxii.), and was
raised on the zoth August, as appears from Lancaster's own despatch, printed in
Avesbury. Baker makes it last till after the Decollation of St. John, 29th August.

Pago 79, l. 1. Godesn’dus de Harecourt. Godefroi d’Harcourt, son of Jean iii., comte
d'Harcourt, was banished, in consequence of a duel, in July, 1344 ; and .went over
to Edward’s side, doing homage to him in June, 1345. He went back to Philip
at the time of the siege of Calais ; but changed sides again in 1356, in which year
he was slain—Lettenhove's F roissart, xxi. 514.

-—- l. 7. Comes Norbamplom'e et ceten'. The return of the English from Brittany
after the campaign of 1345 is evidently confused by Baker (‘ ut descriptum est ’)
with that of 1342.

——- 1. 12. Postea dominus rex. The following is Stow's translation (Annales, 377) :
‘ King Edward prepared to make a voyage into Normandy, his navy being ready to
transport him from Portesmouth and Dorchester, with the earles of Nox-thampton,
Arundell, Warwicke‚ Harecourt‚ Huntingdon, Oxenford, and Suffolke, the bishop
