Pago 90, l. 28. Obsessi interea per srjgna. ‘ In the meane season, they which were
besieged made known their state to the French king by signes and tokens, for
at his first comming they within the towne set up his ancient on the chiefest
tower of the castle, and also they set out banners of the dukes and earles of
France, and a little after the shutting in of the evening they made a great light
on the top of one of the highest towers whichwas towards the army of the
Frenchmen, and therewithal they made a great shoute and noyse with trumpets
and drummes. The second night they made the like, but some what lesse. The
third night a very small fire, giving forth therewith a sorrowfull voyce, signifying
thereby that their strength touching the keeping of the towne was quite spent
and done. And the same night they tooke in all their flags and ancients,
except their standart. At the last, the day of battell drew on, against which
time there came out of England and Dutchland‚ toward the helpe os king Edward,
17,ooo fighting men, whereupon the French king betimes in the morning of the
second daye of August, making fire in his tents, fledde, whose taile the duke of
Lancaster and carle of N orthampton cutting off, they slewe and tooke many of
them. When they of Caleis perceived this, they tooke their standart downe, and
with great sorrow cast it from the tower downe into the ditch, and on the
Satterday following John de Vienna, their captaine, a man very skilfull in
warlike affayres, opening the gates of the towne‚ came out to the king of
England, sitting on a little nagge, for that hee being lame on his'feete could not

well goe, with an halter about his necke, with the other burgesses and souldiours
following on foote, bare headed and bare footed, having halters about their

neckes. The captaine, comming thus before the king, offered him a warlike
sworde, as unto the chiefest prince of armes amongst all Christian kings and
as one that had taken that towne from the mightiest Christian king by noble
chivalry. Then he delivered to him the keyes of the towne. Thirdly he, re·
questing of him pitte‚ asked pardon and delivered him the sworde of peace,
wherewith he should give right judgement‚ spare and forbeare the humble and
lowly, and chasten the proude hearted. The king receiving that which was
offered him sent the captaine, with fifteene knights and as many burgesses, into
England, enriching them with large gists. The common sort of people and such
as he found in the towne‚ being somewhat refreshed with the kings almeS, he
commaunded to be safe conducted to the castle of GuisneS.'—Stow, Annales, 382.

Avesbury dates the surrender of Calais on Friday the 3rd August, a day
earlier than Knyghton and Baker. Knyghton's account, 2594, may be com·
pared with our chronicle: ‘Igitur cum vidissent cives Calesiae vecordiam Fran·
corum, subtraxerunt de muris vexilla Franciae et vexilla regis Angliae quartilata
