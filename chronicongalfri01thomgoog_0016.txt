vi PREFACE.

The larger chronicle is also the work os Baker. Os this there
can be no doubt, although his name does not appear in any pan
os it. Not only is the work found in company with the ‘chroniculum ⁰
in the Bodley MS„ but also in a certain passage the author addresses
sir Thomas de la More, the same knight at whose request Baker had
written the shorter work in 1347.

The occurrence os de la More’s name has been the cause of
depriving Baker os the honour os the authorship os at least a part
os his work. For his history os Edward the second’s reign came,
by some accident, to be attributed to his patron, and has been quoted
under the good knight's name by a succession os writers. Towards
the close os the sixteenth century this portion os Baker's chronicle
appears to have become popular by the dissemination os copieS, tran·
scribed, apparently with some abridgment and alterations⁹ from MSS.
now lost. The title which these transcripts bore was: ‘Vita et Mors
Edwardi secundi, Gallice conscripta a generosissimo milite. Thoma de
la Moore.’ 1 think that there can be little doubt that they were
taken from MSS. which contained Baker's chronicle os Edward the
second's reign only. Had MSS. (such as the Bodley MS. os our
text) containing the whole chronicle and the ‘chroniculum ⁹ also been
used, the attribution to sir Thomas de la More could hardly have
been put sorward, with the evidence os Baker’s authorship so
manifest. And further, the condition os the Cotton MS„ presently
to be described, which has the text os Edward the third’s reign
only, copied apparently as a separate chronicle, favours the view os
the two reigns having been in some copies treated as two distinct
workS.

The ‘Vita ct Mors· was first printed by Camden in his Angis‘ca,
Nor-mamista, lle'bcrm'ca, etc.. in 1603; and it has recently had the
benefit os being rte-edited by the Bishop of Oxsord ¹. Referring to the
