wounded him. But on the other side John had no such shorte kinde of tcaput.
wherewith he might hurt Thomas face, and therefore cryed out aloude nnn
horribly; whereupon by the kings commaundement the combate was ended and
the victorie adjudged to Thomas, who gave the said John, being thus overcome,
to the prince of Wales, for a captive, and offered uppe his owne annour to Sam:
George in Saint Pauls church at London, with great devotion. These marten
being thus finished, the Cipres man is manumitted and set at libertie as a free
man againe. And Thomas, thinking boldely to goe into the presence of δὴ
brother, the French king, tooke his Journey thither, and at his comming found
the said king and the nobilitie of Fraunce greatly offended and in indignana-
against him, for that he agreed that the combate should be tried before the
king of England. Wherefore Thomas, thinking secretly with himselfe ho- to
winne the false friendship of his brother, being desirous to shore that thuein
he had done well, among all other things he greatly praised the nobilitie of
Edward and his worthie fame spread over al the world, and also the justice *meh

the king also, was commaunded by the king himselfe to beare away the price
and pricke from them all. These commendatione did the French king eni-ie at.
and for indignation hee most wickedly commaunded the setters forth of the-e
prayses to bee beheaded. And for to colour the matter the better, hee farm-d
that the earle used too much familiaritie with the queene, his n‘fe. and that
his brother was guiltie of ueason against the king of Fraunce, because he cnun-
mitted his cause and the combat to be thus tryed by the judgement of the kmg
of England. After hee had thus murdered his brother, hee tormented his nie
