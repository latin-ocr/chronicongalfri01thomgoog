so great: for, when he perceived that the French men had turned themselves to
withstand him, he cast away the scaberd of his sword, and comforting his men
about him, setting them in good order, exhorted them to play the men lustily.
The archers‚ being placed in the marish against the sides of the enemies, stood on
drie hines, which were compassed about with quagge-myres and foggie places,
that neither horse-men nor foote·men might approch them, but they should rather
be drowned in mndde then come neere to hurt them: these also did the king
comfort, saying to them “ Doe well, you archers, play the men lustily, and knowe
that 1 am Edward of Windsore.” Then the presence of the king and necessitie of
the matter stirred up their hearts to doe well : the archei-3, uncovering their heads,
stripping up their sleeves‚ bent themselves to bestow their arrowes in such sorte
that they might not be lost: and, as the French men drew towards them, they
saluted them after with their arrowes. The armed men of both parts stood in
order to fight upon a long and narrowe causeway, the breadth whereof was not
able to receive scarce twentie men of armes in a front, having on both sides thereos
the marish, in the which the archers were placed, who gawled and wounded their
enemies on the sides, fleeing as thicke as haile. The king and his men before
with the archers on the side slewe and tooke a great many: and many of them
stood stoutly to it, till at the length by the comming of the prince of Wales the
French were put to flight. After a long chase in pursuing the enemies, they re·
turning backe againe to Caleis numbred those which were fied, as well as those
which were taken, and they found that for the taking of the castle (as the prisoners
reported) there came a thousand men of armes and sixe hundred armed men, but
they which served were above three thousand ........ Thus by pollicie and de·
vised treason the authors thereos came to death and destruction: neither Eusta-
chius himselfe escaped scotfree from the snare5‚ for he, within a while after, being
taken by the French men, was burned alive with a hot yron, and degraded from
the order of knighthood by the cutting off of his heeles and depriving of his tongue
by abscition: afterward‚ he was hanged up, and last of all beheaded and quar·
tered, receiving just punishment for his treason and false forswearing.’

The story of the attempt on Calais is best known from Froissart's picturesque
narrative, founded on Le Bel. It is curious that there should be confusion re-
garding the date of the event. Le Bel gives the year 1348, and in this he is fol-
lowed by certain MSS. of Froissart, while in others the more correct date 1349 is
found. Baker also, as we have seen, inclines to 1348. The actual attempt took
place in the night between the last day of 1349 and New Year's day 1350. The
Grandes Chroniques de France, v. 491, and Avesbury‚ 408, whose account of the
affair is very well given‚-are both in the right as regards the year. The confusion
between 1348 and 1349 may have arisen (as it does appear to have arisen in
Baker's mind) from the fact that Edward was at Calais at about the same time in
both years.
