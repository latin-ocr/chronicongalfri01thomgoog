NOTES ΛΝΒ ILLUSTRA TIONS. 187

Ποτωὶῑαιιι, stertunt, quos irrita somnia mutant,
Fortes se putant, patriae confinia vertunt.
Explicat exercitus splendentia sig-na per arva:
Jam sunt dispersi, nimis est virtus sua parva.'

Α few verses describing the pitfalls form one os the few passages in which the
poet condescends to details ε

‘Machina plena malis pedibus formatur equiniS,
Concava cum paliS, ne pergant absque ruinis.
Plebs foveas fodit, ut per eas labantur equestres,
Et pereant si quos videant transire pedestres!

With a modest consciousness of shortcomings he concludes:
‘Sum Carmelita, Baston cognomine dictuS,
Qui doleo vita, in tali strage relictus.
Si quid deliqui, si quae recitanda reliqui,
Haec addant hi qui non sunt sermonis iniqui.’

Pace 7, 1. 27. In crastino Scotae', etc. Barbour’s Brus (Spalding Club), 262, describes
the stmtagem os the pitfalls in the following lines :

‘And in ane plane feld by the way,
Quhar he thocht ned behufit a way
The Inglishmen, gif that tha wald
Throu the Park to the castell hald,
He gert rnen mony pottis ma

of ane sut bred round, and all tha
War dep up till ane manis kne,

Sa thik that tha micht liknit be

Till ane wax-cayme that beis mais.
Thus all that nicht travaland he was
Sa that or day was he had mad
Tha pottis, and tham helit had

With stikis and with gyrs all grene
Sa that tha micht nocht wele be sene.

The king, quhen that the mes was done,
Went furth to see the pottis sone,

And at his liking saw tham mad:

On athir sid the way wele brad

It was pottit as 1 has tald.

Gis that thar fais on hors will hald
Furth in that way, 1 trow tha sall
Nocht wele eschap foronten fall!
