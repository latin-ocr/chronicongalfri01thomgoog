· NOTES ΛΝΒ ILL USTRA TJOA'S. 235

Pege 60, l. 8. Prcsatus Walterus, etc. Bal-:er here simply follows Murimuth. The
attack on Cadzand, an island at the mouth of the western Scheldt, which· was held
by Guy, bastard· brother of Louis of Flanders, was the object of an organized expe-
dition under the earl of Derby. The garrison was routed on the loth November.

— l. 16. Duos cardinales. They were Pedro Gomez de Barroso‚ cardinal of
St. Praxedes, and Bertrand de Montfavez, cardinal of St. Mary in Aquir0. They
arrived in England at the end of November, 1337. On the 24th December
Edward engaged himself to the'm not to invade France before the 1st March;
and the time was afterwards extended to midsummer, but revoked on the 6th
May—Faciem, ii. 1006, 1007, 1034.

Pago 61, l. 4. optulit, inquam, etc. Compare the schedule of negotiationS, 28th
August, 1337, in the Gesla Edwardi III, 131, and in Faedera, ii. 994.

—— l. 9. Secum habuerunt Iohannem, etc. John Stratford, archbishop of Canterbury,
Richard Bury, bishop of Durham, Robert de Ufsord, earl of Suffolk, sir Geoffrey
le Scrope, and John de Ufl'ord, archdeacon of Ely, were the English envoys,
appointed on the 21st June—Faciem, ii. 1043.

-— l. 25. Qui erat xvtjj. kalendas Augusti. Edward sailed from Orwell (apparently
in the ship ‘ Christopher') between six and seven o'clock in the morning (media
hora inter horam primam et secundam ⁹) on the 16th July.—Foedera, ii. ¹050·

Pago 62, l. 3. Postea rex Coloniam adivit. Baker, following Murimuth, has here got
into confusion. There was but one meeting, that at Coblentz, between Edward and
Louis of Bavaria. Edward set out from Antwerp on the 16th August, 1338,
reached Cologne on the 23rd‚ and Coblentz on the 31st. The ceremony of his

installation as vicar of the empire took place on the 5th September. See Pauli,
Pictures os Old England (English ed. 1861), pp. 151 sqq.; and Murimuth, 84.

— l. 12. Concessa suit regi lana. At the parliament of N orthampton, 26th July—
2nd August. See Murimuth, 85, 86 3 and Knyghton, 2571.

— L 22. Ceperunt v. magnas naves. Murimuth, p. 87, has the 29th September
as the date of their capture. The continuator of N angiS, ii. 161, gives the names
of two of the ships: the ‘Christopher' and the ‘Edward.’ From Murimuth,

106, we learn that two, the ‘Christopher' and the ‘Black Cog,’ were recap-
tured at the battle of Sluys; and Edward writing to his son after the battle

(N icolas„ Ht'st. qstlaee Navy, ii. 61) also mentions the recovery of the ‘ Christopher.’
Hemingburgh, ii. 356, states that three cogs, the ‘Edward,’ the ‘Catharine,' and
the ‘ Rose,' ‘olim de manibus Anglorum in mari sublatos,' were retaken. Balter,
69, it will be observed has, through misunderstanding M urimuth’s narrative,
assumed that the two great French ships, the ‘Saint Denis’ and the ‘Saint George,'
also formed part of the English shipping which the French had previously captured.
Minot (Poems, ed. J. Hall, 1887, p. 8) has gone completely wrong in laying the
scene off Yarmouth in the lsle of Wight, and in making the king take part in the
