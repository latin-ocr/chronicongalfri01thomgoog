track; although here and there a corruption, or perhaps the absolute disap-
pearance of a place from the face of the country, may baffle all attempts at
identification.

lt is not improbable that a certain document quoted by Beltz in his Memorials
osche Garter, appendix iv. (p. 390), may contain information which would help to
identify the doubtful places. This document is the roll of payments made by the
prince’s comptroller, John Henxeworth, from the zoth September, 1355, to the
30th June, 1356, and is preserved among the records os the Duchy of Cornwall.
1 have not had access to these records; and Beltz’s extracts are unfortunately very
meagre. 1 had hoped that possibly he might have taken a copy of Henxeworth’s
roll, which would be still in existence among his papers at the College os Arms ;
but this is unhappily not the case, sor an examination of the papers, which were
kindly placed at my disposal by Sir Albert Woods, Garter, proved that Beltz
contented himself with little more than the few extracts which he has printed.

ln the following outline of the expedition, it should be noticed that the writer
of the itinerary marched with the prince of Wales’s ‘ battle ' or division. In some
instances he names the halting places of all three ‘ battles' into which the army
was divided3 but generally he mentions only a single place, which, unless the
whole force happened to be quartered there, would be the prince's bivouac. The
distances between placeS, as given beloxv, have been calculated by measurements
from the maps ; they must not therefore be accepted as persectly accurate, sor no
allowance is made sor the inequalities os the surface of the country. For our
present purpose, however, they may suffice.

5 Oct. (Monday). The army marches from Bordeaux, south, having the
Garonne on its left, and halts at ‘ Urnoun,' said to be at a distance of 2 miles
from the city. This place is probably Villenave d'Ornon, a little more than
4 miles from Bordeaux. Henxeworth's roll calls the place ‘ Ornoun.'

- 6 Oct. (T uesday). Along the course of the Garonne to Langon, about 21 miles,
and thence to the castle os ‘Andert' or ‘Audert' (Henxeworth calls it ⁴ Andotte,'

‘Andorte,’ and ‘Endorte'), no doubt Castets-en-Dorthe, about 4 miles E. of
Langon.

7 Oct. ( Wednesday). Halt.
8 Oct. (Thursday). To Bazas, 9 miles S. os Langon.
9 Oct. (Friday). Halt.

ιο Oct. (Saturday). To ‘castrum Nau' (Castelnau), in the Laudes, 11
il . .E.
ωιῖεέεῗ. (Sunday). To Arouille: a long march of 21 miles S. by W. Here,
being about to enter the enemy's country, the army was arrayed in ‘ battles,' the

whole numbering more than 60‚000 men. (lt should be noticcd that MS. C.
confounds Arouille with La Reole on the Garonne.)

12 Oct. (Monday). Halt. Various forays.
13 Oct. (T uesday). To Monclar, a short march os 7 or 8 miles S.E.‚ in a hilly

country. Three neighbouring towns burnt, one being Estang, 4 miles S. of Monclar.
14, 15 Oct. (Wednesday, T hursday). Halt.
