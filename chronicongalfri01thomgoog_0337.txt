be anticipating. William Bohun, 1st earl of Northampton, and Robert Ufsord,
1st earl of Suffolk, and sir William Pia-warine became knights of the order at
an early date3 but Roger Mortirner, here styled ‘ nunc comes Marchie,’ did not
have that title before 1352, and sir Walter Manny did not receive the garter tin
the end os 1359.

The date of the foundation os the order of the Gai-ter has never been exactly
determined. Froissart, iii. 37, places it in the year 1344; but it is evident that
the festival which he describes is the one in which Edward established the Round
Table only. Murimuth, 155, gives a full account of this festival, which was cele-
brated at Windsor and began on the 19th Jan. 3 the Round Table was established
on the 28th Jan„ and its first festival was appointed sor Whitsuntide, 23rd May.
The Brute chronicle (Egerton MS. 650) has this description, although under
a wrong year: ‘And in the xix. yere of his regne, anone astte, in Jannuere, before
Lenten, pe same kyng Edward lete make sulle noble iustice and grete festes in pe
place of hys byrth, at Wyndsore, pat Per were never none suche seyne before
pat tyme, ne 1 trowe sythene. At whech iustice, festis and ryalte weryn ij. kinges,
ij. quenys‚ and Pe prince of Wales and pe duke of Cornewale, x. erles, ix. coun-
tesse, many barons, knyghttes, and worthy burgesse, pe whech myght not lyghtly
be nombrede3 and also of dyverse londes as byyonde pe see were many strangers.
And at pat tyme, whene pe iustes had done, pe kyng Edward made a grete
souper, in pe wheche he begone fyrst hys round table, and ordayned stedfastly
the day of Pe forsayd table to be holde per at Wyndessore in pe Whytesonwyke
evermore yerely.'

Relying on the date given in the statutes of the order and on this passage
in Baker, writers on the subject have adopted 1349 or 1350 as the year os foun-
dation. But an entry in the household-book of the Black Prince affords a reason
t‘or dating the event a year earlier, payment having been made on the 18th
November, 1348, sor twenty-four garters which were given by the prince ‘ militibus
de societate garteriae.’—Beltz, Memorials qs the Garter, pp. mcii, 385. Proof
however is not conclusive, as the ministers' accounts in the household-book
were rendered between 1352 and 1365, and there is therefore room {or error3
moreover, the garters in question may have been prepared in anticipation. The
date os 1349, which is given in the preamble to the earliest copies of the statutes,
although it is true that those copies are not contemporary, is not to be lightly
set aside. 1t is, indeed, most probable that the order was never solemnly
instituted at an early period, but that it was gradually taking shape during
the years following the foundation of the Round Table. Edward's patent, bearing
date os 22nd August, 1348, whereby he instituted a chapel at Windsor, with
a fraternity of eight secular canons and a warden, fifteen other canem, and ’
four—and·twenty poor knights, appears to be the first formal document which
can be quoted as a foundation-deed of the order. After this there is no direct
reference to it ‘until 1350, when robes were issued for the King against the
coming Feast os St. George, together with a Garter containing the King's motto,
Hony soyt qui mal y pense.'—Nicolas‚ Ht'st. qs orders qs K nightkood, i. 24.
