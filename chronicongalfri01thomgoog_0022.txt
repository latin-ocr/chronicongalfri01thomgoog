France and the battle of Crecy; the battle os Neville’s Cross ; the
siege and sall os Calais; the Black Death; the foundation os the order
of the Garter; the sea-light with the Spaniards off Winchelsea; the
duel os Thomas de la Marche ς the capture os Guines castle; the battle
os Mauron3 the duke os Lancaster’s single combat with Otho os
Brunswick; the Black Prince's march from Bordeaux to Narbonne
and back, the route being described with a fulness which is found in
no other writer; and, lastly, the battle os Poitiers, the details os which
are set forth with remarkable precision. Baker's history os these
events was drawn upon, to no small extent, by the historian stow,
who has imported into the 1605 edition os his Annales translations,

more or less correct, os many long passages. And through this
medium much os Baker’s narrative has found its way into more
recent works.

The two MSS. which have been used sor the present edition are
the only known copies os the chronicle, viz. Bodley MS. 761, and
Cotton MS. Appendix ιιι. The former contains the chronicle and
the ‘chroniculum’3 the latter, a portion only of the chronicle os the
reign os Edward the third. The text in the Bodley MS. was printed
in 1847 by Dr. Giles, as one os the publications os the Caxton Society.
Giles made use os a transcripn his work was imperfectly performed ;
and there is very good reason sor believing that he never saw the
original M S. at all.

The Bodley MS. is a volume os 200 leaves (including [ly-leaves) os
paper, measuring 12 by 8 inches‚ os the stout make which was in use
about the year 1360 or immediately aster. lt is still bound in the old
oaken covers. The original contents are :—

1. Thesaurus pauperum: recipes sor various complaints, in latin,
drawn from the Thesaurus Pauperum os Petrus Hispanus ; followed
by others in French. Colophon: ‘Expliciunt secreta H. Samp-
sonis dc ClouburneL’ s. 4.

2. ‘Id comence la novele cirurgerie en Franceis par rime.’ Regius:
