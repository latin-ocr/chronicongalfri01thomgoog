the attempt on Calais as happening at this time, whereas we know that it took
place a suu year later.

Pago 103, l. 1. Instante prestita solempnitate. stow, Annales, 387, translates thus,
not always correctly: ‘ During which feast and solemnitie, it was signified to the
king by the secretaries of Emericus of Padua, who was a seed man to the king of
England, that on the fourteenth day os Januarie next comming Geffrey Charney,
knight, and many other F renchmen should be received into Caleis, unto whom
the said towne was solde by the said Emericus. But the towne being presently
rescued by king Edwarde, the said Emericus of Padua with other Genoways con-
tinued in Caleis, being maintained there at the costs of the French king against
the king os England, when he besieged it ; who also, after the yeelding of it to the
king of England, being pardoned both of life and limme, from thencesorth con·
tinued and dwelt as a seed man of the kings in the said towne sor the defence
thereos. At that time the said Geffrey was lord of Matas, a man more skilsul in
war than any F rench man in Fraunce. Whersore he was greatly esteemed, even
to the time os his death. This crasty deviser indevoured by his letters, wherein
hee made promise os large giftes os gold and other sophisticall perswasionS, quite
to subvert the saith and loyaltie of the said Emericus. Finally, this craftie de·
viser agreed with this salse man that sor twentie thousand French crownes he
should let in the F rench men to the town, and, as much as lay in him, deliver up
to the F rench men both the towne and castle. This bargaine being most traiter-

withstanding, he wrote letters unto the king touching the state os the whole matter,
but very privily, how that he was readie to shew friendship to the French men,
yet meaning to make frustrate their purpose, whereby they should be convicted os
breaking the truce, and also many os them should bee taken to bee raunsomed.
Wheresore king Edward speedily passed over, being accompanied with his eldest
sonne, the earle os March, and a few other, comming before the time appointed
for the yeelding os the towne certaine daies. Therefore, being come to Caleis,
hee laid certaine men of armes within the vaultes which were betwixt the outter
gate and the inner parte of the castle, building a thinne and slender wall before
them newly set up, not made of plaister but os countersaite matter, which joyned
to the other wall, craftily devised and made like the olde woorke, so that no man
would judge that any were enclosed therein. Also he caused the maine postes of
the drawe bridge to bee sawed almost in sunder, yet in such sorte that armed
horse-men might ride over it3 and sor the purpose he had a great stone, which
was laid up in a hole made in form of an arch, being in the forepart of the tower
hanging over the bridge, in which he appointed a faithful} souldier should bee, in
due time to throwe downe the said stone upon the bridge, that with the sall
thereos the bridge being halfe cut in two should bee broken in sunder, and so that
hole, where the stone was laid, should bee wrought in such sort that hee within
shoulde perceive through the hole how many did enter in. F ewe were made privie
