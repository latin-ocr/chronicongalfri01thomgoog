ΡισοΊΘ, 1. 2 5. Tandem die tertio decimo. The route of Edward’s march in the C νέᾳ

campaign, across the north os france, from La Hougue to Calais, is here tneed
with great sumetis, and there is no difficulty in identit'ying almost every place that
is named. There is, however, a lack os dates, so that, were there no other means
os checking the daily advance os the army, it would be hard, is not impossible, to
make out the successive stages with perfect accuracy. Fortunately there is exunt
the journal of the king's kitchen, kept during the expedition, in which arc recorded
the names of the places where the king lodged, generally with accompanrin‘
dates, This document is quoted in ⁴ Prooss os the early use os Gunpowder in the
English Army,’ by Mr.Joseph Hunter, printed in Archaeolaffia, xxxii. There u
also a contemporary itinerary, copied in a hand os the 1 5th century, in the Cotton
MS. Cleopatra D. vii. s. 179. from these two documents and Baker't mute
a perfect itinerary can be constructed.

There arc extant also several letters written during the campaign, which exstet
more or less into details. These are the letters os Edward to sir Thomas Luty
(Coxe, T lte Black Prince, by Cleandos Herum, Roxburghe club, 1842, p. 3511, to
the archbishop οἱ Cantcrbury (Lettcnhove's fromari, xviii. 285), and to the arch·
bishop os York (Chron. Lanercost, 342); of Banholomeve Burghersh (Murimuth,
200, 202) 3 os Thomas Bradwardin, chancellor os St. Paul‘s (ibid. 201) ς ut Michael
N orthburgh (ibid. 212 3 Avesbury‚ 358, 367) ; and of Richard Wynktley, the
lting's consessor (Murimuth, 2153 Avesbury‚ 362).
