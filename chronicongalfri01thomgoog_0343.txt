NOTES AND ILL USTRA TJONS. 285

fellow chanced to lye with a laundres, a strumpet, and learned of her where, be-
yond the principall ditch, from the bottome of the ditch, there was a wall made
of two foote broade‚ stretching from the rampiers to the brimme of the ditch
within forth, so that, being covered with water, it could not be seen, but not so
drowned but that a man going aloft thereon should not be wet past the kneeS, it
being made for the use of fishers: and therefore in the middest it was discon-
tinued for the space of two foote: and so the archer (his harlot shewing it to him)
measured the height of the wall with a threede. These things thus knowne, one
day, slipping downe from the wall, he passed the ditch by that hidden wall, and,
lying hidde in the marish till evening, came in the night neere unto Caleis, where
tarying for the cloere day, he then went into the towne (for else he might not).
Here he instructed thern that were greedie of pray and to scale the castle, how they
might enter the same: they caused ladders to be made to the length by the archer
appoynted. Thirtie men conspiring together, clothing themselves in black armour
without any brightnesse, went to the castle by the guiding of the said John de
Dancaster, and climing the wall with their ladders they slew the watchmen and
threw them down headlong beside the wall. After this, in the han they slew many
whom they found unarmed, playing at the chesse and hasard. Then they brake
into the chambers and turrets upon the ladies and knights that lay there asleepe,
and so were made masters of all that was within; and shutting all the prisoners
into a strong chamber‚ being bereft of all their armour, they tooke out the Eng-
lishtnen that had been taken the yeere before and there kept in prison, and, after
they had relieved thern well with meate and drinke, they made thern guardeins
over them that had them in custodie: and so they wan all the fortresses of the
. castle, unknown to them that were in the towne (appointed to oversee the
repayring of the broken walles) what had happened to them within the castle. 1n
the morning they commanded the workemen in the towne to cesse from their
workeS, who, thereupon perceiving that the castle was wonne, straightwaies fied,
and the new castilians suffered the ladies to depart on horsebacke, with their
apparell, writingS, and muniments, where they ought to hold their fees. And the
same day there carne from Caleis to their ayde such persons as they sent for, by
whose ayde they kept the castle: and about three of the clock there came two
knights, sent from the earle of Guisnes, who demanding a truce willed to know of
them that were thus entred the castle, who they were, to whom they belonged,
and by whose authoritie they kept the castle so taken in the time of truce3 where·
unto they answered that, being intruded, they would not declare to any man their
purpose, till they had tryed a longer possession : and therefore on S. Mawrice day,
the abbot, (the king being busie in parliament,) the Frenchmen being sent from
the said earle of Guisnes declared hoW, in prejudice of the truce, the said castle
was taken and therefore by right of mutuall faith it ought to bee restored to them.
The king answered that without his knowledge that enterprise was made, and
therefore he gave commandetnent to his subjects that none of them should deteine
the castle of Guisnes‚ but deliver it unto the lawfull lords thereof. The messengers
being returned horne and reporting what they had done, the earle of Guisnes
