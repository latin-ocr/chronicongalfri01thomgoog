Balter‘s account of the battle of Poitiers is very valuable. His details are un·
usually clear. They were evidently supplied by one who had taken part in the
action, and they compare very favourabty with the somewhat perplexed narrative
os Froissart‚ the chief authority upon which all descriptione. os the battle hue

vanguard under Warwick and Oxiord‚ (2) the main-guard under the primae, and
(3) the rear-guard under Salisbury and Suffollt. The first and third «mimz,-
called the second) divisions were drawn up on ground (⁴campus,' p. 147), which
was separated from the open space (⁴ planicie ¹) occupied by the Prench by a long
bedge and ditch (⁴ sepe longa subterfossata ’). The position was a platan which
sloped down on the right into a valley, the bottom marshy and watered by a
stream (⁴ torrente quodam irriguus '); the hedge following the slope and running
