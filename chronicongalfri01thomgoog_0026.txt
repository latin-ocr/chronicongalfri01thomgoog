xvi PREFACE.

who was a well-wisher, is not also a dependent os the same powerful
house.

The Cotton MS. does not appear to have formed any part os the
Cottonian library, as catalogued. It was found among the burnt MSS.
which suffered in the disastrous fire os 1731 at Ashburnham Hense,
westminster. lt now consists os 22 leaves of vellum, which measure
generally about 9} by 6} inches, the earlier leaves being rather smaller
and more shrunken by the action of the fise, and the first hals os the
whole number beinga good deal damaged and desaced. The writing is
os the latter part of the sourteenth century, perhaps of about the year
1370. It containS, as already noticed, a part os Baker's chronicle sor
the reign of Edward the third only, and it probably never contained
the earlier reign, sor the condition of the first page, worn and desaced.
is not that os one which has had the protection os leaves preceding it.
Moreover, the text begins at the top of the page and with a decorated
initial letter, as in the case of an independent work. All these circum·
stances point to the omission, from the first, of the history os Edward
the second's reign; and support the suggestion, put sorward above,
that the two reigns were sometimes transcribed as separate works in
different MSS.

The reason sor this rather unusual proceeding is, 1 think, to be
found in the arrangement of the text os the beginning os Edward the
third's reign in the Bodley MS. Here we have, sor the first three
years, two versions (see pp. 34-43 below), the second written imme·
diately after the first. The second version is that which appears in the
Cotton MS. It would seem, then, that Baker, aster bringing his chron·
icle to its present conclusion under the year 1356, intended to revise,
or re·write, his history of Edward the third, and that he had actually
commenced the work when, probably, death overtook him. For it
will be seen srom his concluding words (p. 155) that he was then
writing as late as 1358 ; and, as the copy in the Bodley MS„ the
unrevised work ol' a carelcss transcriber, was written in or soon aster
