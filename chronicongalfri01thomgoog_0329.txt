NOTES AND JLLUSTRATJONS. 281

Pago 100, 1. 24. Rex, suo navigio, etc. Edward first issued orders for the gathering
of ships at Sandwich on the 23rd July.—See N icolas, Hist. ⁰s tlte Navy, ii. 103.
Baker is wrong in including the earl of Gloucester among those present. The
title bad become extinct with the death of Hugh de Audeley in 1347.

Pago 110, l. 3. Magne buscee [spanienses. ‘ Et estoient cil Espagnol en ces grosses
nefs plus hautes et plus grandes asses que les nefs Englesces ne fuissent; si
avoient grant avantage de traire, de lancier et de getter grans bariaus de fier,
dont it donnoient moult a souffrir les Engles.’—Froissart, iv. 94. The busse
was a large vessel, comparatively short, but broad in the beam and deep in

the hold.

——1 19. Vasa plena [spanis vacuabant. This was literally the case with the two
ships which Edward and the Black Prince individually attacked, their own
ships sinking from injuries done to them by collision with the beavier Spanish
vessels.

Pace 111, l. ι. Muse cornubus. The cornemuse was a kind of bagpipe.

-- 1. 4. Decem et saeptem. Froissart states that the Spaniards lost 14 ships ; Aves-
bury says 24; Walsingham, if he may be quoted as of any account, gives the
number at 26. Baker's number is probably correct.

Pace 112, 1. 8. Iohannem Bateman. The Christian name should be William. The
bishop of N orwich was despatched, about Michaelmas of this year, with other
envoys to negotiate at the papal court for a peace with Franoe.—Foedera, iii. 201.
The creation here referred to consisted of fifteen new cardinals, eleven of whom,
as Baker correctly informs us, were Frenchmen.

— l. 17. Duo nu'lites. ‘Two hyred souldiers of the king of Armenia came into
England, into the presence of the king, where they shewed the letters of the
aforesaid king of Armenia, wherein it was signified that the one of them, to wit
John de Viscount, a man borne in Cipres, had slanderously charged the other,
that is, Thomas de la March, a French man borne and bastard sonne to Philip,
late king of France, saying that the said Thomas should have received of the
Turkes a certaine summe of gold, for the betraying the armie of the Christians
unto the Emperour of the Turkes; and, for the proofe of this slander, this John
challenged a combate with the said Thomas», to be tried by the judgement of
Edward‚ king of England, and that by him (as by a most worthie prince) all
strife should be ended. For this therefore were these two worthie souldiers
appointed to fight, which they perfourmed within the listes of the kings palaoe
at westminster, on Munday next following after the feast of Saint Michael,
where Thomas, in declaration of his innocencie, in that he was accused of,
overcame his enemie, but yet killed him not, because he was not able to wounde
him, being so armed, with any kinde of piercing weapon, except it were in his
face, which was bare. For, after that they had mnne at the tilte and fought
on foooe, as they were striving together on the ground, with certaine prickes
