. . . . In crastinum producitur comes in aulam coram justitiariis assignatis, et sin·
gillatim species transgressioniS, ac pro quolibet articulo adicitur poena specialis,
videlicet, ut primo protraheretur, deinde suspenderetur, ac postremo capite trun·
caretur. Sed ob reverentiam regii sanguinis poena protractionis est remissa, sus-
pensio suspensa, sed poena pro omnibus decreta. At comeS, volens se in aliquibus
excusare, nitebatur quaedam statim allegare; sed justitiarii noluerunt ipsum audire,
quia verba dampnatorum sicut nec nocent nec possunt proficere. Tunc ait comes:
“ Fortis est haec curia, e't major imperio, ubi non auditur responsio nec aliqua ad·
mittitur excusatio.” . . . Deinde educitur comes extra castrum, et ascendens quod-
dam vile jumentum conductus est ad capitolium. Tunc comes quasi orando caput
extendit, et spiculator bis uel ter percutiens caput amputavit. Et haec acta sunt
mense Martii, anno regni quintodecimo.'— Vita Edw. IL, 270.
