this burying·place is become a fair garden, retaining the old name of Pardon
Church-yard.'-—Stow, Survey os London, ed. 1754-5‚ ii. 60. Sir Walter Manny
purchased an adjoining piece of land of more than thirteen acres, the site of
the Charterhouse which he founded in 1371. Stow says that he had seen a
stone cross which stood in Manny's cemetery, bearing an inscription which
recorded the burial of 50,οοο victims of the plague.

Pago 99,1. 20. Iohannes de Montgomurri. He died in 1348, for John Beauchamp was

appointed captain of Calais on the 1st January, 1349. Owing to the transposition
of words in the Bodleian MS. (or, at least, in the MS. which he used) Stow
(Annales, 386) has made ‘ Lord Clisteles ' captain of Calais Who this Clisteles
was, does not appear. He was, however, probably of the family of the lords
of Ghistelles in Flanders. Wulfart de Ghistelles was in Edward’s service, and
was the officer who captured Poix in the Crecy campaign (Bourgeois de Valen-
ciennes, 225). The name is not found in the list of persons buried in the church
of the White Friars, in Stow's Survey (i. 742). There is however an Elianor
GristleS, or Gistles‚ who may have been one of his family.

vel duos dies et dimidium diem.’-Knyghton, 2599. ‘Nullum quidem quem
mori voluit ultra tres vel quatuor dies vivere vix permisit, sine delectu etiam
personarum, paucis divitibus dumtaxat exceptis.'—Avesbury‚ 407.

Pace 100,1. 10. Scoti gavrki. ‘Scoti audientes de crudeli peste Anglorum suspi-
cati sunt de manu Dei vindici hoc eis evenisse, et sumpserunt injuramentum‚
prout vulgaris rumor aures Anglorum personuit, sub hac forma, quando jurare
volebant: Per foedam mortem Anglortim, Anglice ‘⁴ Be the foul deth ‘of Enge-
lond.” Et sic Scoti, credentes vindictam Dei horribilem Anglos obumbrasse,
convenerunt in foresta de Selfchirche in proposito invasisse totum regnum
Angliae. Supervenit saeva mortalitas et ventilavit Scotos subita et immanis
mortis crudelitas; et moriebantur in parvo ternpore circiter v. millia. Reliqui
vero, quidam debiles, quidam fortes, repatriare se disponebant; set Angligenae
eos praeoccupaverunt insequentes, et occiderunt ex eis multos nimis.’—Knyghton,
2 599-2600.

— l. 20. T ranssretarunt episcopus, etc. The commissioners were the bishop of
N orwich, the earls of N orthampton and Huntingdon, the prior of Rochester‚

and others. On the 2nd May, 1349, the truce was prolonged to Whitsuntide,

—-— l. 26. Ceterum comes Flandn'e. Baker is here evidently referring to the treaty
of December, 1348. He has, with some excuse, a very vague idea of what was
going on in the Low Countries‚ and in this paragraph and in the one on page 102
seems to have set down a confused statement of what he probably gathered from
English solders who had served there. It was after the treaty of ι 348 that Louis
de Male returned to Ghent and the fight between the two factions of the fullers
and the weavers took place, in which the latter were defeated. The count thus
