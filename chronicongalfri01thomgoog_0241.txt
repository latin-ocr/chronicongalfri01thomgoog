his keeper the carle of Leicester3 these three crastily compassed him, counselling
him to make resignation of the crowne to his eldest sonne, promising him no
lesse honor and renowne after the deposition of his royall dignitie‚ then his
princelie estate was woont to have of all men before. They added also, what
a great reward it woulde bee at the hands of God, for the peace and quietnes
of his subiects, for him to refuse the governement of a temporall kingdome. In
the other part they throetned him that, if he would not make resignation, the
people withdrawing their homage and obedience, saith and friendship unto him,
his sonnes also being forsaken, they would crowne another king, none os the
royall blood. With these and other promises and threats, the king (not without
sobbes and teares) agreed to the advertisernents of the byshopS. Finallie‚ that
mischievous embassadour Adam de Orleton‚ bishop of Hereford, brought to
the castell, wherein the king was shut up, the kings other enimieS, whome he
placed orderlie according to their dignities in the ‘kinges chamber, reserving
unto himselfe the thinges which hee had sought long time before. At length
the king comming foorth of his secret chamber, being clothed in a mourning
gowne, shewing himself to his servants, knowing the businesse for which they
came, sor verie sorrow beeing as it were distraught os his wittes, sodainelie

. swouned. The earle of Leicester and the bishop of winchester did take him
up, being almost dead; and being called to his senseS, Adam de Orleton‚
byshoppe of Hereforde‚ declaring the cause os the messengers comming, did
adde that the king should make resignation of the crowne and realme to his
eldoet sonne, or else, aster that himselse was refused, hee shoulde suffer them
to choose to their king another fitter man, whome they thought good for the
defence of the kingdome. The king hearing this, with much mourning
answeared that hee was verie sorie that the commons had conceiyed such
wrath and indignation against him, that they disdained to bee governed under
his mle, for the which hee asked them forgivenesse, and finallie added that hee
would be very glad is they would receive his sonne to be their king.’—Stow,
