NOTES ΛΝΒ ILLUSTRA TIONS. 289

Christi, quam idem dux reliquit in ecclesia sua collegiali quam fundavit sub
castro Leicestriae.' It is remarkable that F roissart does not mention the quarrel,
which would have provided ample material for a picturesque description.

Pagem, 1. 16. Fuit ordinatum, etc. There is no record of this ordinance; but
it need not be therefore assumed that a proclamation or some official warning
was not issued. It was in the parliament of 1350-1351 that proclamation was
made against games played by children in Westminster, among others that of
knocking off the hats of passers-by : ‘ come a oustier chaperons des gentz.'

-- l. 20. Bladi carim‘a. The price of wheat, which was high at the beginning
of the year 1352, fell in some instances fifty per cent. in the course of six months.
This fall, according to Professor Rogers, ‘ appears to have arisen in part at least,
from anticipation of an abundant harvest.’——Hist. os Agricultura· and Prices,
i. 209. It may also, in some measure, be attributed to the importation here
recorded.

— l. 27. Sancti Mathei vel Mathis, etc. The parliament of 1353 was holden on
the Monday after St. Matthew, the 23rd September. By the statute which was
then passed, staples were established at N ewcastle-upon-Tyne, York, Lincoln,
Norwich, westminster, Canterbury, Chichester, Winchester, Exeter, and Bristol,
in England3 at Caermarthen‚ in Wales; and at Dublin, Waterford, Cork, and
Drogheda, in Ireland—Rot. Parl. ii. 246.

Pago 128,1. 8. Profictus est in Scoct’am. This incursion does not appear to be
noticed elsewhere. The attempts to negotiate with the Scots by means of the
personal intervention of their king is described by Knyghton under the years
1352 and 1353: ‘Rex Scotiae David BruS, adhuc prisonarius, missus est in
Scotiam sub custodia cum fidelitate jurata ad revocandum Scotos in fidelitatem
regis Angliae sicut solebant esse, et sicut idem rex David juratus suerat esse
legius homo regis Angliae, et sicut reges Scotiae solent esse. Scoti vero unanimi
assensu sub una voce responderunt se velle regem suum redimere, set se subdere
regi Angliae nequaquam velle: unde rex David reversus est ad turrim Londoni·
ensem’ (2603). ‘David rex Scotiae transit apud Novum castrum super Tynam
tractare de concordia inter Anglos et Scotos3 Scoti vero refutarunt regem suum
nisi se in toto eximeret de consilio Anglorum et similiter de eorum subjectione.
Et minati sunt ei se nolle ipsum redimere nec redemptionem pro eo facere,
nisi pardonaret eis omnes querelas et gravamina per eos facta cunctaque delicta
a tempore captionis ejuS, et de hoc eis securitatem faceret. Sin aliter, mina-
bantur se velle alium regem super se erigere ' (2606).

— 1. 17. Obiit Clemens papa. Clement died on the 6th December, 1352. Balter
at once plunges into the negotiations of 1354. The cardinal of Boulogne was
Guidon de Boulogne, archbishop of LyonS, who was made cardinal in 1342, and
bishop of Porto in 13503 he died in 1373. Α truce was agreed to on the 6th
April (Faedera, iii. 276), to last for a year, and it was arranged that both sides
should send ambassadors to negotiate a peace in presence of the pope. The
