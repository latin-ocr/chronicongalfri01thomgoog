PREFACE. vii

original title of the work, it appears that, from the first, it was assumed
tobe the Latin translation of a life of Edward written in French by
sir Thomas de la More. At the end of his history of the reign Stow,
AnnaleS, ed. 1605, has the colophon: ‘Thus far out of Thomas de 13
More, a worshipfull knight, that then lived and wrote in the French

’ tongue what he saw with his eieS, or heard crediblie reported by thern
that saw and some that were actorS. All which was (at the said sir
Tho. de la Mores request) translated and more orderlie penned in the

Latine toong by Walter Baker, alias Swinborne, chanon os Osney
besides Oxford.’ From this it is clear that Stow used a MS. which con·
tained not only the chronicle but also the ‘ chroniculum ' 3 for otherwise
he would not have known Baker’s name, blundered though it be. And
yet, is it was this same MS. that he lent to Camden, it is strange that
the latter should have entitled some extracts which he made from the
years 1338-1352, (now in the British Museum, Lansdowne MS. 229,
ff. 156 b, 157 a): ‘ Ex historia Thomae de la Mare quam mihi accommo-
davit J. Stowe, 1577 ’ ¹. The Bishop os Oxsord, Chrom‘cles of the retgnS,
etc. 11. lviii, lxxv, has saith in the existence of the French life, and does
not altogether despair of its re·discovery. I venture, however, to think
that the assumption has been carried too far. The passage in the
chronicle on which the theory os a French life is based is to be read
on p. 27 os our text. Baker is there describing the proceedings os
the deputation sent to the king at Kenilworth to procure his abdi-
cation 3 one of the members is Stratsord, bishop os Winchester, and in
Stratsord's train is de la More, probably then a young man: ‘quorum

comitivam,’ writes Baker, ‘aderens predicto episcopo Wintoniensi, tu,
generose miles, qui hec vidisti et in Gallico scripsisti, cuius ego sum

talis qualis interpreS, te dico, domine Thoma de la More, tua sapienti
et inclita presencia decorasti.’ These words surely refer immediately

to the graphic scene which follows—the preliminary conserence os the

¹ Aster comparing Camden's extracts, 1 think that Stow did not use the Bodley MS„
but possibly a not quite accurate copy of it.
