the ship above foure hundreth men slaine. Moreover, the king understanding that
the ships were fled, he sent fourtie ships well appointed to followe them, over the
which he made John Crabbe governor: but what good speede he had is not
knowen. In the first companie of shippes that were taken they found these
conquered shippes, the Denis, the George, the Christopher, and the Blacke Cocke,
all which shippes were taken by Frenchmen at Sluce and carried into N ormandie.
'Ibe number of ships of warre that were taken was about two hundred and thirtie
barges 3 the number of enemies that were slaine and drowned were about five and
twentie thousand, and of Englishmen about foure thousand, among whom were
foure knights, sir Thomas Mortimer the kings cousin, sir Thomas Latimer his

ῗηηε, sir William Butler of Seortkorne, and sir Thomas Poynings.’—Stow,

Pago 68, 1. 4. Apud thpeswicum. Edward was at Shotley, co. Suffolk, at the junction
of the Stour and the Orwell, at the end of May, and again in June to the date of
his setting sail.—Foedera, ii. 1 12 5—1 128.

Sluys are to be found in Edward's own letters, in Murimuth, Avesbury, Heming·
burgh, Knyghton, Minot‚ N angis, Le Bel, and Froissart‚ and, later, in Walsingham.
Among modern writers, sit N. Harris N icolas, History os the Royal Nam, ii. 51, has
given the most exact account. He has embodied al] the information to be gathered
from contemporary writers known to him, but, having found that which is given
here in Baker's text and in Murimuth (whose chronicle was not then fully in print)
only as quoted by Stow and other later historians, he excluded it from his narrative
and placed it in a foot-note (p. 56) as being of an ⁸ apocryphal character.' Muri·
muth and Baker are the authorities for the statement that the French fleet sailed
out the space of a mile to meet the English3 and the movement is a150, though

more obscurely, described by Knyghton (⁴ divertit se de portu de Swyne’). The ·

English fleet had lain the previous night off Blanckenberghe, some ten miles
westward of the haven of Sluys. Edward would have therefore approached the
enemy from nearly due west. But, before engaging, he executed a manoeuvre
which is thus described by Froissart (ii. 35): ‘ Quant li rois d’Engleterre et si
mareschal eurent ordene leurs batailles et leur navies bellement et sagement, il
fisent tendre et traire les voiles contremont, et vinrent au vent, de quartier, sus
destre, pour avoir l'avantage dou solen, qui en venant lor estoit ou visage. Si
s'aviserent et regarderent que ce les pooit trop nuire, et detriierent un petit, et
tournierent tant qu’il l'eurent a leur volente.’ That is to say, the wind blowing
probably from the north or north-east, the English fleet went about and stood
away to the north-west, thus getting the advantage of the wind for the attack.
(Τὴε manoeuvre, as appears both from F roissart and Avesbury, was mistaken by
the enemy for a retreat.) But the object of the movement was, further, to get the
advantage of the sun and also of the tide. Baker's words (following Murimuth)
are ‘post horam nonam, quando habuit ventum et solem a tergo et impetum fluminis
secum! Edward himself also, in his letter to his son describing the battle (Nicolas‚
