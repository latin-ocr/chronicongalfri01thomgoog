quote Baker’s words (p. 45): ‘ Illum non alio nomine quam titulo comitis Marchiae
ausus est aliquis nominare! Baker’s reference to Gaveston’s good service against
the Scots applies no doubt to the campaign of 1310-11.

Pago 4,1. 12. Predicte coronacione· affuerunt, ete. The chronicles vary as to the foreign
guests. Murimuth names Charles le Bel, the' duke ol Brittany, Henry of Luxem-
burg, and Louis os Evreux3 the Annales Paulini and Walsingham, more correctly
apparently, name Charles of Valois and Louis os Evreux‚ the queen’s uncles, the
duke and duchess os Brabant, and the count os Savoy; the Contin. Τ rivet. men-
tions wrongly, among others, Charles and Louis, the queen’s brothers. The -
F rench king's letter sending Charles of Valois, 9th Feb„ is printed in the Foedera,
ii. 31. In the.ceremony the latter put on the king his right boot and spur.

—-· 1. 15. Set Petrus de Gavestone, etc. Gaveston carried the crown (Annal. paulin,

ed. Stubbs, Rolls Series, 261). He also redeemed the ‘ curtana ’ sword, apparently
sor the return procession, and fixed the spur on the king’s lest foot.—-Foedera, ii.

36. His ‘ostentation at the banquet is thus noticed in the Annales Paulini, 262 :
⁴ Petrus vero, non regis sed gloriam propriam quaerenS, et quasi Anglos contemp·
nens, ubi ceteri in deauratis vestibus incedebant, ipse in purpura, margaritis in-
texta preciosis, inter convivas, quasi rege pretiosior equitabat. Quapropter indig-
natus comes unus voluit interimere eum palam. Cui alius sanior respondebat:

‘⁴ Non in die festo, ne forte fiat tumultus in populo et dedecus in convivio· Sed
expectare vincere nobis erit.” ’

-- 1. 18. Rex, ut deliniret animos, etc. Gaveston was banished a second time by
decree os parliament in the spring of 1308. The publication of banisbment issued

from Bristol on the 28th June, having been appointed regent os Ireland on the
16th of the month.--Faedera, ii. 51. ‘ Terminus itaque positus est, dies videlicet
sancti Johannis baptistae, quo et eodem sesto per anni revolutionem elapso idem
Petrus eandem terram prius abjuraverat. Adveniente igitur die praefixo, dominus
rex et Petrus curn multo comitatu ad portum Bristolliae sunt profecti 3 ibidemque
post modicum a rege licentiatus, Petrus cum multa familia in partes Hiberniae se
transtulit et recepit, totaque terra ex praecepto domini regis Angliae suae domina-
tioni et potestati subdita est. . . . ·. . Petrus in Hibernia jam moram faciens ornnes
redditus illius terrae, qui ad regem Angliae pertinebant, ex voluntate regis et prae-
cepto, in suos usus assumpsit et consumpsit, sicque novissimus error priore sactus
est pejor.’— Vita Edw. IL, 159. He returned to England early in July, 1309;
served in the campaign against the Scots in 1310-1 13 and was placed sor security
in Bamborough, when Edward returned to the south in July, 131 1.

Pago 5,1. 4. Petrus revocatus, etc. Baker has entirely omitted Gaveston's move·
ments in 1311-12. He seems to have confused Bamborough and Scarborough.
By the Ordinances, Gaveston was again banished 1st Nov., 1311. He went to
F landers, but returned almost immediately, and rejoined Edward at York at the

beginning os the new year3 the king's writ declaring his banisbment illegal
