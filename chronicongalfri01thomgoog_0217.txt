London„ 206). He gave him over to Lancaster‚ who with his confederates led him
out to execution, the earl of Warwick remaining in his castle. Murimuth (Rolls
Series), p. 17, is evidently wrong in stating that Warwick dismissed him and that
he was afterwards made prisoner again. In the following extract from the Annales
London„ 207, it will be seen that his execution took place at Blacklow-hnl, or
Gaversike, which lies about a mile north of Warwick, in order that the &erl might
be relieved of immediate responsibility ε

‘Die ergo Lunae proxima ante festum sancti Johannis baptistae, anno prae·
dicte, videlicet xixmo die Junii, praedicti comites cum suis venerunt apud
Warwyke et petierunt corpus dicti Petri a praedicto comite Warwiciae3 quem
praedictus comes Warwiciae dictis comitibus tradidit corpus ejus sanum et
salvum3 at ipsi fecerunt conduci corpus dicti Petri extra villam Warwiciae, et extra
feodum dicti comitis Warwiciae, ad Gaverissweche, inter Warwyk et Kilne-
worthe, et in feodo comitis Lancastriae3 et ibidem fuit decollatus», circa horam
meridiei, per manus cujusdam Britonis, coram omni populo ibidem coadunato.
Et sic recesserunt unusquisque ad propria, relinquentes corpus dicti Petri in
area ubi ipse de'collatus est. Tunc quatuor sutores de Warwick posuerunt corpus
mortui super scalam, reportantes versus Warwyk‚ ibidem sepeliendum; sed et
comes Warwiciae, qui toto tempore decollationis non exivit de castro, fecit corpus
reportare ad eundem locum, ubi prius decollatus fuit, extra feodum suum; et
ecce fratres Jacobini conduxerunt corpus ejus apud Oxoniam, ubi multum
honorifice custoditur: unde multum sunt in odio de comitibus praedictis!

The nicknames which Gaveston gave, with such deadly offence, to certain
lords are noticed by several of the chroniclers. All does not appear to have
been properly explained. The chronicle of Lanercost, 216, refers to them in
these words: ‘ Ipse enirn, credens se in comitatu pro suo perpetuo confirmatum,
cum esset alienigena et de sola gratia regis tantum honorem adeptuS, jam in
tantam superbiam est erectus quod omnes nobiles comites terrae contempsit, et
vilia cognomina eis deridendo imposuit, inter quos cum comitem Warwici, virum
utique sapientem et probum, vocasset ‘⁴ Nigrum Canem de Arderne,” et esset hoc
postea comiti intimatum, ille dicitur curn patientia respondisse: “Si vocet me
canem, pro certo ego mordebo eum, quando videbo tempus meum.” ’

The prose Brute chronicle has also some interesting particulars on this point.
This chronicle is extant in both a French and an English version. Of the F rench
version there are two editions, both compiled in the reign of Edward 111„ and
ending with the account of the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333. From the second
edition of this French version the English version was translated3 and to this
translation further additions were subsequently made. The names of the writers
are unknown, but it appears that one of the later editions of the English version
is due to John Maundeville‚ rector of Burnham Thorp, co. Norfolk‚ 1427-1441
(Notes and Qumis, 1856, p. t). To the authorship of the second edition of the
French version perhaps a clue may be found in certain extracts, or rather trans·
lations, from a F rench chronicle, which are printed in Leland's Collectanea,
i. 454. At the head of these extracts Leland has this note: ‘Wylliam de
