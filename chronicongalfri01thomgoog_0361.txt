they should suffer no man to make any chase, but only 500 horsemen, wel
appointed, to come out against the archers in the beginning of the conflict‚ and to
run them over and to tread thern under their horse feete ε but these performed
not that which was commaunded them, as it appeared by the sequele thereos.
‘The armies being set in a readinesse on both sides for to fight earely on
Sonday in the morning, which was notable fayre, behold there came the cardinall
of Petragoren‚ and charged the prince, in the name of God who was crucified, Α
that it might please him tosdeferre the warre for a time, both for ecclesiasticall
peace and also for the sparing of Christian blood>and to the end there might be
a treatie had of peace, the which he promised should be performed with great
honour on both sideS. The prince neither feared nor refused peace, but modestly
agreed to the request of this father. All this day now being appointed for the
obtaining of peace, the armie of the F renchmen encreased by the number of a
thousand men of armes and also of other. On the morrowe after, the cardinall
carne againe from the F rench king, in his behalfe to request a truce which should
endure for one whole yeere, the which the prince denyed, yet, at the importunate
sute of that cardinaJl‚ he graunted a truce to continue till Christmas next comming.
Therefore the cardinall, returning to the French king, requested him of pledges
for the truce ; but the marshall Dawdenam, Geffrey de Charney, and Douglas the

Scot perswaded him that by common reason it could not come to passe that the
Englishmen should at that time prevaile‚ and especially because they were but

fewe and in a strange countrey and wearied out miserably with their toyle in
travell, and therefore not able to indure so great a number of the F renchmen of
France who stood in defence of their owne land.

‘The prince of VVales being certified that the captaines of the French would
have no kind of peace, but such as they could get by force of armeS, and calling
his men together, ‘he made to them an oration, first in general and then to his
archerS, as foloweth : ‘⁴ Your manhood (saith he) hath bin alwaies known to me,

in great dangerS, which sheweth that you are not degenerate from true sonnes of
English men, but to be descended from the blood os them which heretofore were

under my fathers dukedome and his predecessors, kings of England, unto whom
no labor was paineful‚ no place invincible, no ground unpassable‚ no hill (were it
