NOTES ΛΝΒ ILL USTRA TIONS. 305

Then came on the cruell company of crosbowmen, making a darknes in the skiee
with the multitud of quarrels which they shot, against whom came a worQ‘com-
pany os English bowmen; out flies also darts of ash which met with the enemie
asar off : but the F rench armie, being ful of divers troupes and many armed men
desending their brests with their shields, proceed sorward against their enemies :
wherefore our archei-S, having emptied their quivers in vaine, being armed onely
with swordes and targets, are faine to encounter with them that were laden with
armour. Then bestirreth himself the worthy prince of Wales, cutting and hewing
the F renchmen with a sharpe sword.

‘ ln the meane time captaine de la Buche marcheth a compasse about, under the
hanging of the hill, which he with the prince a little before forsooke, and, privily
compassing about the fielde, at the length commeth close under the place where
the F rencb campe lay; from thence he ascended to the toppe of the hill that way
which the Frenchmen had beaten with their travaile, and so sodainly breaking
forth unlooked for, and shewing by the ensigne of Saint George that he was our
friend, the prince with great courage giveth a fresh charge on the Frencb armie,
being desirous to breake their rankeS, before the captaine aforesayde should set
on the side of the battayle. The prince‚ lustily encountring with his enemies,
goeth into the middle of the throng‚ and where be seeth most company, there hee
layeth about him on every side.

‘ In the meane time, on every side, his friendes which served captaine de la Buche
were at the backes of the enemies, beating ,dowoe and killing without pitte‚ and
the archers als0, placed for the purpose, shot so thicke, wounding the backes and
sides of the F renchmen, in such sort, that the fourme of the battaile was quite
spoyled, neither could they put themselves in order or aray any more. This was
the courage of the prince‚ who at the length thrusteth thorow the throngs of them
that guarded the Frencb king. T hen should you see an antient beginne to nod
and stumble, the bearers of them to fall downe 3 the blood of slaves and princes
ran mingled together into the waters which were nigb. In like sorte the bore of
Cornewall rageth, who seeketh to have none other way to the F rench king's stan-
dard then by blood onely : but, when they came there, they met with a company
os stoute men to withstand them, the Englishmen fight, the Frenchmen also lay
on, but at length, Fortune making haste to turne her wheele, the prince preaseth
sorward on his enemies, and, like a fierce lion boeting downe the proud, he came
to the yeelding up os the Frencb king.

‘ The F renchmen being scattered abroad in the fieldes os Poyters„ perceyving
that the standard with the flowredeluce was beaten downe, ssed with all speede to·
wards the towne, which was not farre off : the English men, perceyving them to
be fleeing, though themselves were either sore wounded or wearied, followed them
in chase even to the gates of Poyters, where in a great skirmish and very daun·
gerous they slew a great number of F renchmen.

‘At the last, our men being called backe by retreate with the sound os trumpet,
and assembling together, there were diverse pavilions and tents set up in the fields,
and the whole company, being throughly comforted with this victorie, gave their
