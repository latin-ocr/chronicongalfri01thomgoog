brother-in-law, was created earl of Cambridge 011 1110 7111 May, 1340. He died
in 1361. Baker appears to have confused John of Hainault with the marquiS.
1t is probably from this passage that Camden (Britannia) has compiled his state-
ment that the earldom was conferred on John of Hainault, but taken from him
when he deserted to the F rench.

agreed to a short truce.

of three values: six shillings, three shilling5‚ and eighteen pence-the first
gold coinage that had been struck since 1257. Βο1 11 was found that they were
valued at too high a rate, and they were therefore superseded hythe coinage of
nobles, and were finally recalled on the 20111 August. The nobles were issued by
