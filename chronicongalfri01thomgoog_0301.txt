On comparing these two itineraries with that given in the text, it will be seen
that there are certain discrepancies. In some instances these are no doubt due
to mere blundering3 but others may be accounted sor as variations of three dis-
serent statements written independently by persons marching with different
divisions os the army. Putting the three itineraries together, we can lay down
the following route :—-

12Ju1y(Wednesday). Landing at Saint— Vaast· de· la· -.Hougue Baker has in-
advertently dated this event the 13th July; but, as he speaks os the next day as
Thursday, heis only wrong in the day os the month.

13 July (Thursday). Headquarters at Morsalines, only two or three miles from
St. Vaast. The Kitchen Journal does not notice the removal. Halt of five days.
The country wasted, and Barfleur burnt [on Friday, 14th July].

18 July (T uesday). To ValogneS, 9 miles S.W.

19 July (Wednesday). To Saint·C<⁸>me·du-Mont, just north of the river Douve,
14 miles S. by E. Cott. MS. fixes the halt at ‘ Caueny,’ no doubt Coigny, 5 miles
W. os Saint-Cbme·du-Mont. Probably one of the divisions lay there.

20 July ( Thursday). Across the Douve to Carentan, only two or three miles.

21 July (Fm’day). The K. J. and Cott. MS. name Pom-Heben, a town lying
11 miles s.E. of Carentan and about 4 miles N .W. of saint-LO, as the halting
place sor this day. Baiter records the march to ‘Serins,’ Saint-Lo, and Tor-igni,
and their destruction, and then gives Cormolain as the king's headquarters sor
the night. He has clearly compressed the events of two days into one. ⁴ Serins ’
is probably a clerica] ‘error sor Sem‘ns, Sept-Vents or Sevans, the place which
K. J. calls ⁸ Sevance! 11· ‘ Serins ⁹ were the correct reading, it might mean Cerisy·
la·Foret or cerisy-I’Abbaye, which however lies too much off the route.

v 22 July (Saturday). To Saint-Lo (K. J. and Cott. MS.)

23 July (Sunday). To Sept-Vents (K. J.) about 12 miles S.E. of Saint·Lo.
Cormolain, mentioned by Baker and Cott. MS„ is not sar from Sept-Vents‚ and
may be reckoned as the halting·place os some part of the army.
