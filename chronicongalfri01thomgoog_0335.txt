NOTES ANB ILL (JSYRA TJONS. 27 7

Pago 106,1. 12. Cognita demum, etc. Avesbury‚ 410, says that Edward was left, by the
action of the fight, with only thirty men-at·arms and a few archers : ‘ Hoc consi·
derans praedictus dominus Galsridus de Charny, modicum distans a rege, cum una
magna acie nobilium hominum armorum equitum de F rancigenis movebat se
versus regem. Tunc dictus dominus rex, in tali et tanto periculo constitutus,
animum non submisit, sed, sicut miles strenuus et magnanimus, evaginavit gladium
suum et alta voce protulit haec verba : “ A l Edward, seint George! A Ξ Edward,
seint George! '' Et cum Francigeni haec verba audissent, adeo fuerant attoniti
quod perdiderunt animum, sicut unus nobilis de eisdem F rancigenis ibidem captus

postea narravit.’ The light along the causeway is nowhere told so well as by
Baker.

Pago 107,1. ιο. Ex hiis suerunt capti, etc. The list of French.names here given
differs considerably from that found in Froissart ; and many of thern are so dis-
guised by misspelling that their identification is hopeless. Geoffroi de Charny
had a son os the same name. Oudart de Renty commanded the party which was
sent forward and was admitted within the walls. In ‘ Garinus Baillof' we recognize
Gauvain de Bailleul‚ and in ‘ Ewstacius Rypplemont ' Eustache de Ribemont, the
gallant knight, on whose head Edward placed his own cap (chapelet) as he gave
him his liberty, and who afterwards fell at Poitiers. Jean de Mortagne, seigneur
de LandaS, appears among the prisoners in F roissart’s narrative. He also fell at
Poitiers. He married, in 1344, Jeanne de Hennes, widow os Jean de Chatillon,
comte de saint-Pol. Baker is wrong in giving this lady the title of countess of
Pernbroke ς it was Marie, daughter os Cui de Chatillon, comte de Saint-Pol, and
therefore sister of count Jean‚ who, in 1320, married Aylmer de Valence, earl of
Pembroke. Robert‚ called Moreau, de Fiennes is also mentioned by Froissart as
effecting his escape; but, besides Henri du Bois, the same chronicler names Pepin
de Wierre as slain. Who ‘ dominus Archebaud ' may have been does not appear.
Among the other names ‘de Banquilo’ may be a corruption os Boucicaut‚ and
‘ Dargemole,’ of d'Argeville ; ‘ dominus de Mountmarissi ' is possibly Charles de
Montmorency3 and ‘ dominus de Planke' may be the sire de Plancy. As to the
‘ alius Eustacius de Ripplemont,' Eustache de Ribemont had a son Waleran who,
according to the Bourgeois de Valenciennes, 266, was badly wounded and made
prisoner ς there appears to have been no second Eustache.

·-— 1. 26. Set nec Emericus evasit. Froissart gives the story os Americo di Pavia's
capture by Geoffroi de Charny at a small castle named Frethun, near Calais, and
states that he was taken to saint-omer and there put to death. Π this is correct,
the date of the event must be early in 1 3 52, when de Charny was again in those
parts, aster being ransomed in August, 1351.—Luce's Froissart, iv. xxxviii.

Pago 108, l. 4. Eodem anno comes Lancastn’e. The carl os Lancaster was appointed
lieutenant os Poitou on the ¹8th October, 1349.—Foedera‚ iii. 190. Knyghton de·
scribes the campaign thus: ‘ Comes Lancastriae Henricus equitavit cum Vasconicis
medio tempore ad numerum xxx. millium super inimicos decem dies et amplius,
et misit igni et flammae totam patriam in circuitu per x. leucas ex omni parte, et
