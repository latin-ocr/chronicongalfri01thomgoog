and 1351, and thus outlived the great plague. He may safely be
identified with the patron of Geoffrey le Baker. I shall not venture to

identify him with sir Thomas de la More who in 1370 was constable
or vice-warden of Porchester Castle under the earl of Arundel‚

although, supposing him to have been a young esquire in the service
of bishop Stratford in 1326, he may easily be supposed to have survived
until the close of the reign of Edward iii ’ ¹.

Whether Baker was a tenant or some such dependent of his
patron is now beyond our power to show; but it is more than probable
that the family of de la More had land in, or in the immediate neigh-
b‘ourhood of, Swinbrook, and that the chronicler held some relation of
this kind towards the reverend knight ².

There was also a greater Oxfordshire family than the de la Mores
with whom Baker seems to have had some connection. The Bohuns,
earls of Hereford‚ were lords of the hundred of Chadlington, in which
Swinbrook lies. And it will not escape the observation of the reader
that Baker speaks with particular reverence of the generous character
of the unfortunate earl who fell fighting on the wrong side at Borough·
bridge, and that he describes the manner of his death with some
minuteness. The details also which he gives of the drowning of
Edward Bohun in the north are somewhat fuller than in other chro-
nicles. That this attention to the history of individuals is more than

² A curious piece of evidence showing that, at a later period, at least one of the family
was in possession of land on the very borders os Swinbrook pas-ish has been kindly
communicated to me by the Bishop os Oxford. It consists of the following memorandum
of ownership, written in a copy of Bishop Hall's Explication qs all the hard texts os the
old and New Τ estaments, which was quoted in a second-hand bookseller's catalogue last
year: “ Thomas More de la More dwelleth in Pagan’s Court in Teynton nere Swinbroke
and Burford, in Oxfordshire, N ov. 1652. Cornet to The. Fairfax‚ 1647.'’ The village of
Taynton lies a mile on the western side of Burford‚ while Swinbrook lies to the east 3 but
there is an outlying portion of Taynton parish close to Swinbrook‚ and at the very
southern extremity of it is “ Pain's Farm,'' just half a mile north os the village. This,
1 have no doubt, is the ‘⁴ Pagan's Court ’⁹ where dwelt Fairfax's quondam comet. Thus
the names of More and Swinbrook are once more brought together some three centuries
after our chronicler had passed across the scene.
