manie, as well within the castle as without, heard it, perceiving it to be the cry of
one that suffred violent death, which caused manie of Barkley and also of the
castle (as themselves affirmed) to take compassion thereos, and to praie for the
soule of him that was then departing the world. And this was the end of Edwarde
of Carnarvon, being betrayed as is aforesaid: but to colour the matter, that they
might seeme guiltlesse in this case, lsabel and the bishop of Hereford laboured
to cleare themselves by banishing and outlawing of Thomas Gorney and John

Maltravers, laying as it were all the fault upon them. This Thomas Gorney, ’

flying to Marsils and there lying hid privilie the space of three years, was at
length espied and taken, and as he was brought towarde England, there to have
received just and worthy punishment for his desertS, he was beheaded on the sea,
fearing that, if he had beene brought into England, he would have accused divers
other great personages. The other, to wit, John Maltravers, living in great con·
trition and repentance, spent a long time in Dutchlandl—Stow, Annales, 350-

held at the close of the year 1330, sir Thomas Gournay (or Gurney) and william
Ocle were condemned as the actual murderers of Edward 11., and a price was put
upon their heads, as both had fied. ThomaS, lord Berkeley, to whom, in associa·
tion with sir John Maltravers, the custody of Edward was entrusted, was also
proceeded against, but defended himself on the plea that he was detained by
illness at his manor of Bradley when the murder took place. He was tried
before a jury of knights, and acquitted of participation in the murder, but held
guilty of deputing his trust to unworthy persons. Sir John Maltravers was
likewise condemned in this parliament3 not, however, for the murder of Edward,
but for his share in bringing about the death of the earl of Kent. He also had
fled. Twenty years afterwards he prayed for the reversal of his attainder, and
ultimately received pardon. Ocle disappears ; and there can be little doubt that he
died abroad. The fate of Gournay has been traced in a valuable paper contributed
by Mr. Hunter to Archaeologv’a, vol. xxvii. He was not arrested at Marseilles, as
stated by Baker, following Murimuth¹3 but, in the first instance, at Burgos in
Spain. N ews of bis arrest reached England in the middle of the year 1331, and
the king’s messenger, Egidius de Ispannia, was despatched to take over the
custody of the prisoner. The messenger was, however, kept dancing attendance
on the king of Spain, who, perhaps from sheer dilatorineSS, delayed the surrender.
Meanwhile Gournay escaped. But at the close of the following year he was again
arrested in Naples‚ news of his capture reaching England in January, 1333. A
Yorkshire knight, sir William de Thweng, was sent out to Naples and received
custody of the prisoner. After sundry adventures he reached Bayonne; but
there Gournay, whose health had given way, died. The body was probably
embalmed, as Thweng’s compotus contains items of sums expended for two

¹ Murimuth, p. 54, in the earlier edition of his chronicle, names Marseilles as the place of
Gournay’s arrest (in one MS. 1t ts added: ⁶ ad procurationem cujusdam dominae de Ang ιι '); m
the later edition this is altered to ⁸ in partibus transmarinis?
