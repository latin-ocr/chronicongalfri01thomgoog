Pago 66, l. 1. Movit s< versus exercitum. On Sunday, the 17th October, Etienne
de la Baume‚ the master of the French crossbowmen, wrote, from St. Quentin,
to Hugh of Geneva, in Edward’s service, to arrange a battle, and enclosed a
challenge, in Philip’s name, to Edward, to fight on the following Thursday or
Friday. Hugh replied on the next day, writing from Origny·sainte·Benoite,
Edward's headquarters‚ which lies a little to the east of St. Quentin, and accept-
ing the challenge. On Tuesday, the 19th October, the king of Bohemia and the
duke of Lorraine wrote a confirmatory letter to Hugh of Geneva, still dating from
St. Quentin. On Wednesday Edward prepared for battle, falling back and
choosing his ground, apparently, in front of Flamengerie3 while Philip moved
out to Buironfosse. The battle did not come off. Philip withdrew on the
Saturday to St. Quentin3 and Edward, aster waiting in the neighbourhood till
the following Monday‚ also retired. The correspondence arranging the battle
is given, in French, in Lettenhove's Froissart, xviii. 873 and, in a Latin form,
in Hemingburgh, ii. 342. It is rather curious that the challenge should have
been conveyed by this means instead of directly. But the correspondents held
high rank. Etienne de la Baume, called ‘le Galloi5,' lord of Valusin, was of an
ancient Burgundian house. He afterwards became lieutenant of Languedoc
and lieutenant-general of the king's armies. He had served also under the

‚ count of Savoy, and in that service no doubt was the comrade of Hugh of
Geneva, whom he also styles his cousin. The latter was the son of Arne ii„
count of Geneva, and was lord of Vareys and Authon. He enlisted in Edward's
service in 1337, and was employed in many embassies and affairs of trust down
to 1360. He was appointed Edward's lieutenant in Aquitaine in 1340. (Letten-
hove's Froissart‚ xx. 267, xxi. 401 3 Dict. de la Noblesse, ii. 5303 Foedera, ii.
291, etc.) Edward's own account of the campaign is contained in the letter
which he addressed to his son Edward and his council from Brussels on the
lst November (Avesbury, 304). from this source Knyghton has taken details
