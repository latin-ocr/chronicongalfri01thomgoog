defended, and after came to Hastings‚ where they brent fishers cottages‚ with their
boatS, and slew many men. Also, they made great shewes many times against the
lle of Thanet, Dover‚ and Fulkestone, but in those places they did little herme,
except to poore fishermen: thence they sailed about to the havens of Cornwall
and Devonshire, doing in all places much harme to the fishermen, and such ships
as they found unmanned they fiered. At length they entred Plimmouth Haven,

where they brent certaine great ships and a great part of the towne. These were
met by Hugh Courtney, earle of Devonshire, a knight of fourescore yeeres old,

being accompanied with many souldiours of his countrey, who, having lost at the

first front a fewe of his men which were slaine by the quarels of the French‚joyned
to fight with them hand to hand, and, slaying many of the pyrates upon drie land,

chased the residue which fledde to take their gallyes, and, being not able to come
nigh them by wading‚ they were drowned in the sea to the number of five
hundred.'—Stow, Annales, 366.
