wholesome meateS, for melancholy, by some infirmitie he might languish and die.
But this man being by nature strong to suffer paines and patient thorow Gods
grace to abide all griefes, hee endured all the devises os his enemies, for, as touching
poysons which they gave him often to drinke, by the benefite of nature he dispatched

away.’—Stow, Annales, 350.

Pago 80, l. 29. Tum abducitur Edwardus. ‘ These champions bring Edward towardes
Barkeley, being guarded with a rabble os hel-houndeS, along by the grange be-
longing to the castle of Bristowe, where that wicked man Gomey‚ making a crowne
of hay, put it on his head, and the souldiours that were present scoffed and mocked
him beyond all measure saying . . . avaunt sir king . . . . . ε they feared to be met
os anie that should knowe Edward, they bent their journey therefore towardes the
leste hand, riding along over the marish grounds lying by the river of Severne.
Moreover, devising to disfigure him that hee might not bee knowne, they deter-
mine sor to shave as well the haire of his head as also os his beard ε wherefore, as
in their journy they travailed by a little water which ranne in a ditch, they com-
manded him to light from his horse to be shaven, to whome, being set on a moale
hill, a barber came unto him with a hasen of cold water taken out os the ditch, to
shave him withall, saying unto the king that that water should serve for that time.
To whome Edward answered that, would they, noulde they, he would have warm
water sor his heard ; and, to the end that he might keepe his promise, he began
to weepe and to shed teares plentifully. At length they cameto Barkley castle,
where Edward was shut up close like an anchor. Isabell his wife, taking it
grievously that her husbands lise (which she deadly hated) was prolonged, made
her complaint to her schoolemaister Adam de Orleton, faining that she had cer·
taine dreameS, the interpretation whereof shee misliked, which if they were true,
she seared lest, that is her husband be at anie time restored to his olde dignitie,
that hee would burne her sor a traytor or condemne her to perpetuall bondage.
1n like sort the bishop, being guiltie in his owne conscience, stoode in like seare.
The like feare also strooke the hearts of others sor the same offence: wheresore
it seemed good to many os great dignitie and bloud, as well spirituall as temporall,
both men and women, that all such sear should bee taken away, desiring his death:
whereupon there were letters colourably written to the keepers of Edward, greatly
blaming them sor looking so slenderly to the king, suffering him to have such
libertie and nourishing him too delicately. Moreover, there is a privie motion
made unto them, but yet in such sorte as it might seeme halfe done, that the
death os Edward would not bee misliking unto them, whether it were naturall or
violent. And in this point the great deceit of sophisters stoode in force, set downe
by the byshop who wrote thus ι

Eduardum occidere nolite timere bonum est.
Kill Edward doe not feare is a good thing:
To segktssl-:z-S'head king Edwards bloud

Resuse to seare 1 count it good.
