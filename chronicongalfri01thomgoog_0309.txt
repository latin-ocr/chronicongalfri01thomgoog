aster the destruction os the Genoese crossbowmen he does not follow. Wynkeley,
who, like N orthburgh, was a non-combatant, and probably watched the battle
from the rear, with the king's division, speaks of three chargeS, the third being
the most desperate (Murimuth, 216). His letter has evidently formed the basis
of other accounts (Murimuth‚ 246). Knyghton also describes three main at·
tacks.

—Bourg. de Valencicnnes, 232. Louandre, in his account of the battle, Histoire
d’Abbe-m’lle ( ι 844), i. 238, draws from another source the same anecdote of the
young prince’s rescue by his standard-bearet, whom however he names Richard
de Beaumont. The knight who was despatched to the king to ask sor help was,
according to Froissart, iii. 183, Thomas of Norwich. The timely succour of
twenty knights was a much more probable answer to the petition than the romantic
words put into Edward’s mouth by Froissart. The blank lest by Baker sor the
name os the leader of the relieving force may, on the authority os the passage
quoted above from the Bourgeois de Valenciennes, be filled up with that os the
bishop os Durham. Froissart posts the bishop with the* second division under
Northampton, which he describes as advancing to the prince's support just when
the message was sent to the king. Τὴε Bourgeois de Valena‘ennes is more prob-
ably correct (232) in placing him with Edward.

tory attacks were no doubt made far into the night. Knyghton, 2588, confirms
Baker ahnost to the letter: ‘ Rex Edwardus tota nocte cum exercitu suo stetit
in campo, et Franci xvj. vicibus dederunt eis insultum antequam dies illuces-

burgh perhaps meant the earl os Suffolk.
