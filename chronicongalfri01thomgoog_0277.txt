Pago 50, l. 11. Continuata guerra Scotica. Balliol was driven out by a sudden
rising on the 13th December. With the assistance os the English he laid siege
to Berwick on the 12th March, 1333. Baker’s ‘circa festum Nativitatis sancti
Johannis Baptiste' is far too late, that festival falling on the 24th June. Again,
he sets Edward’s arrival at the siege also too late, St. Margaret's day falling on
the zoth July. ln Gesta EdwardiIII theffievent is placed ‘ after Easter,' which
in this year fell on the 4th April.
