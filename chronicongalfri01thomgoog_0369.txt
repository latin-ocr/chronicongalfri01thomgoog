supra fossam et ultra sepem ⁹) were terribly effective3 but those of Warwick's
(first) division, posted in the marsh‚ though out os reach of the enemy, could
do little against the amour—clad horsemen, until moved by Oxford into a
position (probably on the slope of the hill on the-right) whence their arrows
could hit the horses' hind-quarters. Thus the French cavalry were repulsed, and
driven back upon their own advancing infantry, clermont being slain and Audre·
hem a prisoner. Pursuit was restrained, and the English front consolidated by
the union os the first and second divisions. From this statement we must under·
stand that the prince's division (or the main part of it) was brought down from the
hill which it had occupied ¹ and joined to that of Warwick3 but four hundred men
were held in reserve. Then followed the onset of the second French line, or the
first infantry division, under the dauphin‚ which, after a struggle, was repulsed ²,
the English again being held well in hand. We hear nothing from Baker of
Orleans' division, which, as we learn from F roissart, retreated from the field
without striking a blow, leaving only king John’s ‘battle' to be accounted for.
This division, the largest, now advanced to the attack‚ and it is said that some of

the English began to lose courage at the sight, one of the faint-hearted bringing
down upon himself a sharp rebuke from the prince. Then was executed a ilank

movement by a small body (the numbers here given being apparently too low) of
mounted men and archers under the captal de Buch, who was despatched round
the hill on the right to fall upon the F rench rear. This was the moment chosen
by the prince for the advance os the English line. His banner was carried sor·
ward; and, leading out his reserve, he charged down upon thefenemy. The
French, thus taken in front and reverse, were broken up ; and the battle was
won.

Froissart’s account differs from this in many points. According to him, the
duke of Normandy’s division, after being shaken by the recoil of the French
cavalry, was attacked in flank by the force posted on the hill on the English right,
and was then driven from the field by the prince of Wales's advance; while king
John’s division marched forward and engaged the first and third ‘ battles' under
Warwick and Suffolk.

Knyghton's account of the battle is of little or no value3 but he mentions the
exhaustion of the English after the repulse of the Dauphin's attack, and also gives
a list os the French killed and prisoners. The description to be found in the his·
torical poem, ‘The Black Prince,' by Chandos Herald³, demands a moment’s

‘strategic movement to the rear?
