two bishops with the king; the arrival of the rest of the embassy;
the introduction of the unhappy prisoner, clad in his sable robe: his
sudden faint 3 the abdication; and the renunciation of homage-the
scene in which de la More was himself an actor, and it is unnecessary
to read our chronicler otherwise than in the obvious sense that he was
indebted to his patron for a detailed account of it, without straining the
words to apply to an entire history of the king's life. ln fact the
words ‘hec vidisti et in Gallico scripsisti ⁹ confine the limits of de la
More's contribution to what he himself actually saw.

The connection between Baker and his patron has been elucidated
by the researches of the Bishop of Oxford, as set forth in his Introduc·
tion to the volume in which he has re·edited the ⁴ Vita et Mors! lt is
there most clearly proved that Camden and others who have followed
him are quite wrong in identifying sir Thomas de la More as a member
of a family of the name seated in the parish of Bitton in Gloucester·
shire. He belonged, in fact, as might have been expected. to a place
much nearer to Baker’s home. This place was Northmoor‚ formerly
Mora or Moor, in Oxfordshire, lying only some eleven miles south·
east of Swinbrook‚ not far from the Berkshire border of the county.
⁸ ln this place, in the seventh year of Edward i, one John, son of
Stephen de la Mora, held thirty acres of land, a mill. and a passage over
the ThameS. under the prior of Oeen-burst, the tenant in chief, by
annual payment of 53³· and 411. and suit at the hundred court of Chad-
lington. The family of de la More continued to llourish at Northmoor,
for Anthony Wood found there fragments of their sepulchral monu-
ments and evidence of their coat armour, argent 3 fesse dancettcc
gobony gules and sable between three mullets gules. Now in the
first two parliaments of ¹340 sir Thomas de la More sat as knight of
the shire for Oxfordshire, and was 3 member of the great committee
appointed in the second sess-‚ion to sit from day to day until the busi-
ness was finished and the petitions turned into a statute. lle was

evidently a person of great consideration. was again elected in ¹3⁴3
