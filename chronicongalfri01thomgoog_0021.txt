by person's who had had a 'share in them, and in many particulars
bear the stamp of unusual accuracy.

We may then be grateful for the preservation of so much that is
os the greatest historical interest, and may also acknowledge a debt to
Murimuth, feeling that, had his chronicle not existed, we might have
lost the superstructure of Baker's picturesque descriptions; but the
enjoyment is marred by the pedantic craze of the elder chronicler for
making his historic year begin at Michaelmas, which his younger con-
temporary blindly adopts. Baker was certainly not strong in chron·
ology. He evidently did not write his work from year to year. As
already stated, he used an edition of Murimuth which ends in 1341; ‘
and he says that he had the story of Edward the second’s persecution
from William Bishop after the occurrence of ⁴ magna pestilencia,' the
Black Death, in 1348-9. It would appear then that he certainly did
not commence his chronicle until after 1341, to which period he accepts
Murimuth’s dates without question, and that he may not have begun
before the middle os the century. As evidence that he did not write
with regularity, it will be noticed that in several instances he seems to
have mixed the various information which he had gathered from eye·
witnesses of different events some time after they had taken place. For
example, he confuses the campaign in Brittany os 1342 (dating it 1344)
with that os 1345 ¹; and other similar confusions are pointed out in the
notes.

Ι may here briefly capitulate the particular events for the history
of which Baker's chronicle is os special value. They are: the battle
of Bannockburn; queen Isabella's invasion of England, her intrigueS,
and the fall of Edward the second; his persecution and his murder;
the ignominious treaty with the Scots in 13283 the earl of Kent's
restoration plot; the fall of Mortimer; the battle of Halidon Hill; the
battle os Sluys ; the march of Edward the third through the north of

¹ 1 have to confess to falling into this trap; having entered the later date, instead of
1342, in the margin os p. 76 and at the top of p. 77.
