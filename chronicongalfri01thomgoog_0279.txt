French king accounted the king of England not worthie of his friendship, so
long as he continued warres against the Scots, his friendS, whome he said were
just men. Unto the second petition he would not otherwise consent thereunto,
than is all charges were repaid againe‚ which his father Charles de Valoys laid
out in the warres of Gascoigne. Thirdly, he said that he was a friend and lover
of justice and equitie, which he would never swarve from, neither for friendship
nor affinitie, but he would, by all meanes he could, molest and vexe all breakers
os the peace of the kingdome os Scotland: for (saith he) there shall never be
perfect peace and quietnesse among Christians before the king of Fraunce sit in
place of judgement sor the right of the kingdomes os France, England, and
Scotland.'—Stow‚ Annales, 361.
