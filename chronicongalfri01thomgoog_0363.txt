by the earle of warwike, were alwayes readie and met with the Frenchmen,
beating them downe.

‘ The archers of the vawarde were placed in the marish out-of daunger from the
horsemen, yet for all that they did prevaile there somewhat, for the horsemen
were appointed tono other purpose but to overrunne the archerS. The earle of
Oxford, considering the discommoditie that might ensue thereos, departed from
the prince’s warde, and leading with him the archers set them on the one side of
the Frenchmen, commaunding them to shoote at the hinder parts of the horseS, by
meanes whereof the horses being gauld and wounded fell to tumbling with them
that sate on their backeS, or els turned backe and ran upon them that followed
after, making great slaughter upon their owne masters, The horsemen being thus
beaten backe, the archers retired towards the place from whence they came,
shooting and gawling the sides of the Frenchmen which fought right over against
them.

‘ By this time the force and heate of the battell began to be in prime, when as
the earles of Warwike and Salisbury, like fierce lions, endeavoured of purpose
which of them should dung the land of Poyters most with Frenchmen’s blood.
N either was the wise counsellor Thomas Dufford of Suffolke idle at that season,
who right worthily in all his acts behaved himselfe, being expert and skilfull in
activitie. For he, continually running from warde to warde and into all troupes
and companies, comforted and stirred them up with good words to doe well,
havinga great regard that the youthfull sort os lustie souldiers, being too bolde

and placed the archers at sundry times to great advantages, and ostentimeS, as
leysure would suffer him, he would encourage up the minds of the souldiers.
Clarimount was slaine, William Douglas also being wounded fled, having with
him a fewe Scottes of his bande, with Archebald Douglas his brother. Our men
retyring put themselves in good aray, and our vawarde 3ηά middle warde joyned
themselves together.

‘ By and by there marcheth forth a new armie of the Frenchmen, the which the
eldest sonne of the French king, Dolphin of Vienna, brought forth. The order
and aray of this armie was more terrible and fierce then the show of that which
was last oppressed, yet for al that could it not make our men afraid, who were
sharpe set and very desirous of honour and also of revenge, both for themselves
and their felloweS, which a little before were slaine and wounded. And therefore
boldely they go to it on both sides, making showtes and noyse5, crying out:
“ Saint George to borow,” and “ Saint Denis for uS.'’ Within a while they were
come to fight man to man, and, every man ready to die, fight now to save their
lives, neither doth the lion make the wolfe more afraid, as the tiger is more
terrible to the simple beast, then our lusty gentlemen were to their enemieS, who
chased them 3ηά slue them like as the wolves chase and kill sheepe. And though
that this battel withstood our men more then the first, yet, after they had lost a
great many of their men, they had such a devise that they saved many, 3ηά yet
not by running away but by a faire retreate, which the Frenchmen are accustomed
