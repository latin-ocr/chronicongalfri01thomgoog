NQTES AND ILLU STRATIONS.

Pago 1, line 1. This brief account of the campaign of 1303, which is taken from Muri-
muth’s chroniele, is made to include the capture of Stirling, which however had
been taken by the Scots as far back as the end of 1²99· Edward’s operations
extended from May to December. Brechin was the only fortress that made any
resistance.

— l. 15. Reddita est Vasconia. Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, announced that
he had received restitution of the duchy of Aquitaine, zoth May, 1303.—Foedera,
i. 95 5.

——- l. 19. W. de Nogan’to et W. de Plasiano. Guillaume de N ogaret, Philip’s
chancellor, and Guillaume Duplessis‚ who were despatched, together with Sciarra
Colonna, to seize Boniface at Anagni. The pope did not die in the hands of his
enemies. He was rescued by the people of Anagni3 and went to Rome, and
there died a little more than a month after his captivity.

Pago 2, l. 14. Nonaginta dies. The siege ol* Stirling castle lasted from the 22nd
April to the 24th July, or ninety·three days.

— l. 22. Iustict‘an’os de trailbaston. The commission of Trailbaston issued
6th April, 1305. See also Hemingburgh, ii. 235. The term Trailbaston has
been variously interpreted as applying either to the judges or to the offenders.
As early as the time of Trivet it appears to have been taken as a popular
nickname for the judges: ‘ Hi justitiarii ab hominibus popularibus vocati sunt
de Traylebastoun, quod sonat Trahebaculum' (cluam, p. 404). This view is,
however, certainly erroneous. The endorsement on the commission itself shows
that the offence or offenders are indicated: ‘ De transgre. nominatis Trailbaston
audiend. et terminand! 111 the Chronological Abstract (p. 66) prefixed to the
Parliammtary Writs, vol. i., this is pointed out in the following words ε ‘ Τὴε
“Ordinatio de Trailbaston ’' is extant on the Parliamentary Roll (Rot. Parl.‚
vol. i. p. 178). The Commission pur-sues the term of the Ordinance. Lord Coke
says that they were called Justices of Trailbaston because they proceeded as
speedily as one might draw or trail a staff (4 Inst. 34); and others have sup·
posed that they obtained their title from their staves os office. It is obvious,
however, that the name was originally applied either to the offence or to the
offenders’

Langtost (Rolls Series), ii. 360, describes these offenders as common quarrellers,
