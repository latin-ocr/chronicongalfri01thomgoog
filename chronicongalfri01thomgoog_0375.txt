NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 313

Dawdeley made, the French king said that, amongst all stoute champions which
valiantly that day behaved themselveS, he did greatly wonder at the noble deedes
of that knight; and he spake not much more in all his supper but what he spake
to the prince, who comforted his noble pray. Such like words it is said that
the French king spake: “Although it be our chance to fall into an everlasting
sorow, yet for all that we thought it good to refraine from the same by a kind of
measure, for, though we be under subjection by law and right of war under our
noble cousin, yet are we not as rascals or faint hearted runne awayes, or taken
lying hid close in a corner, but after the manner of the fielde by the ende and
successe of wane, where we were as ready to dye as live for justice sake.” And
in the same field were many rich men taken, whose lives were reserved for

ransome, the faint hearted and lewd chased away, but the woorthiest and stoutest
were spoyled of their lives.'—Stow, Annales, 414. It will be notioed that Stow

does not include the last sentence among the king's words,

The story of Audley’s vow to strike the first stroke in the battle, of his
desperate charge among the French cavalry, of his woundS, and of the prince's
care for him, is so well known from Froissart's pages that it needs no repetition.
But his interview with the prince is there placed immediately before the French
king was brought in, and consequently there is no record of any words spoken by
the latter. Baker’s simple account rather mars the romance of the supper-scene
in the F rench chronicle, in which the prince serves his royal prisoner and
humbly refuses to sit at his table. ·
