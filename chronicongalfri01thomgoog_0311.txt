Pago 86, 1. 10. Misit tirannus. ‘ The French king in this meanetime sent a number
os Genowayes and other hired souldiours unto David king os ScotS, earnestly
requesting him that he would invade England with all his force: wheresore about
the 7 os October he with a mighty power entred England, passing along by
Berwicke, which was strongly defended by the Englishmen, and so, ranging over
the forest of Alnewike, they wonne a certaine mannour place called Luden,
belonging to the lord Walter Wake, who yeelded himselfe on condition to be
ransomed, where (Selby a knight being desirous by law of armes to save his life)

he was taken, which when it was known to David, he commanded him to be
slaine: but Selby intreated sor him that he might be brought alive to the

presence of David, who having obtained his request, he falleth downe before
David, requesting his life sor ransome, but he was againe adjudged to die.
The mallee of the tyrant was such, that he commanded two of the children of
the poore knight to be strangled in sight os their father, and afterwards himselfe,
being almost madde for sorrow, was beheaded. From thence the Scots passed
sorward, wasting along the countrey‚ wherein were many sarmers belonging to
the monasterie of Durham‚ and comming within two miles os Durham they tooke
certaine of the monks, which they kept prisoners sor their ransome, making
covenant with the residue for a certaine summe of money and corne to redeeme
their mannours from spoyling. The Englishmen of the marches fleeing before
the sace of the enemie, William de la Zouch, archbishop of Yorke, vicegerent to
the king in the marcheS, calling together the bishop of Carleile‚ the earle of
Anguise, the lord Mowbray, the lord Henry Percy‚ the lord Ralph N evel, Ralph
Hastings, with all their ayde, together with the archers of Lancashire‚ went
towards the armie of the ScotS, and on the eeven of saint Luke met them at a
place called Bewre Parke‚ neere Nevils Crosse. The Scottish nation, not
accustomed to flee, withstoode them stoutely, and. having head-picces on their
heads and targets on their armes», preasing sore upon the Englishmen, they abode
the brunt of the archers: but the men of armes, which were in the soresronts,
gave their enemies many deadly wounds. The marshall os the Scottes, earle
Patrike, who had the charge of the rereward, when he perceived his men to be
beaten downe,bhe fled away with other that were privie to his cowardlines: he
being fled, the residue of the Scottes, continuing faithfully with their king, stoode
about him like a round tower, keeping him in the middle, who so continued till
there was scarce sortie of them left alive, os the which not one of them could
escape away. At length, David their king valiantly fighting and sore burt, an
esquire os Northumberland‚ named John Copland, tooke him, who with eight of
his servants rode straite out of the field with the king, and so rode fifteen leagues
from that place to a castle called Orgalus, the residue about him being taken or
alaine3 the Englishmen pursued the chase aster them which were fled, slaying
and taking them as farre as Prudihow and Corbridge.’—-Stow, Annales, 380.
