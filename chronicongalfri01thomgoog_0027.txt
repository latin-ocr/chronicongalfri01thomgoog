PREFACE. xvii

1360, it may be inferred that Baker died in the interval. The existence
os the two versionS, written, as they are, consecutively in the Bodley
MS„ goes to prove that the MS. was copied direct from Baker's own
original work ; he had probably begun his revised version on inserted
leaves, with the result that the scribe os the Bodley MS. ignorantly
incorporated the new with the old material. More intelligent copyists
afterwards saw what the author intended, and transcribed the reign os
Edward the third with its new commencing version as a separate work,
just as we have it in the Cotton MS.

Os the text of that MS. nearly one half has been lost. The
following are the lacunae t-After s. 1, one leaf (see pp. 39—41, below),
after f. 9, one leaf (pp. 62-64); after f. 1o, a quire os eight leaves (pp. 67-
'96); and, at the end, again a quire of eight leaves (pp. 132-155).

l have only to add that the readings os the two versions just
referred to, as they appear in the Bodley M S„ are here distinguished
by the letters B and ΒΞ. Among the Notes and Illustrations at the
end of the volume Ι have printed many extracts from contemporary
chronicles; and, as he has so largely adopted Baker’s text and has in
turn been so freely referred to by modern historianS, I have thought
it not amiss to give several passages from the Annales of John Stow.
