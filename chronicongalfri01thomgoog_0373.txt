army being on the Poitiers·Chauvigny road, it would naturally march from that
road as its base. F ollowing Baker, then, we may venture to assume that
Warwick's division was drawn up sacing north, or nearly so, on the western slope
of the valley just referred to; and that Salisbury stood on his left rear; their left
being protected, as F roissart describes, by entrenchmentS‚ traces os which have
been discovered. As regards the condition of the valley at the period of the
battle, it is not too much *to adopt Baker's description of it as marshy; and,
although there is now no trace of a stream in it, the ‘torrens' of which our
chronicle speaks may have been some tiny brook, perhaps not much wider than
a ditch, yet sufficiently troublesome for the passage os baggage-waggons. At
all events it is quite clear that Baker cannot be speaking of the Miausson, the
only stream now laid down near the field. Across the valley is the hill, lying
behind La Cardinerie, which the prince's division occupied at the opening
of the battle, and round which the capta] de Buch led his men. That the
⁴ prince of wales, before taking possession of this hill, thought that it was already
held by the enemy, and that, when he had taken up position there, he was

‘hostibus altior incumbens,’ is further proof that the French were approaching
from the north. ’

Pago 143,1. 5. In toto exercitu, etc. Baker’s number of 7000, which he says is
exact, may be accepted. The Bourgeois de Valenciennes (²90) puts the English
at 7000, and the F rench at 50,000. F roissart (v. 32) is nearly in agreement:
⁴ Car il [the English] n’estoient‚ tout compte, non plus de huit mil hommes; et li
F rancois estoient bien cinquante mil combatans, dont il y avoit plus de trois mil
chevaliers! And again (v. 42) he states that ‘li F rancois estoient bien gens
d'armes sept contre un ² 3 although in the Amiens version, written under French
influence‚ he reduces the proportion to ‘cinq contre ung.' In all these calcula-

tions the light armed men, the bidowers, brigands, and others, do not seem to be
included.

-- 1. 22. Insttjgavit coronatum, etc. Le Bel, ii. 197, gives a very good reason sor
dismounting the French troops, which may in fact have had some effect: ‘fut
ordonne que tous se combateroient a pye, pour la doubtance des archiers qui
tousjours tuoieut leurs chevaulx, comme a la bataille de Cressy:

Pace 144, 1. 1. Cardt'naltlr petragon·sens1·s. Talleyrand de Perigord, sometime
bishop of Auxerre, became cardinal in 1331; died in 1364. See the account of

his indefatigable endeavours to prevent the battle, as given in Le Bel and
Froissart.

—- l. ¹3· Concessit treugas. Le Bel, ii. 198, reports the terms offered by the prince
as follows: ‘Enfin fut tant traittie que le prince de Galles, s’acordoit de laissier
toutes les villes et chasteaulx qu'il avoit conquis‚ et quittier de prison le seigneur
de Craon et pluseurs aultres prisonniers, mais que le roy Jehan le laissast issir
hors de son pays; et avecques ce il creanteroit qu’il ne seroit arme jusques a

sept ans contre le royaume de France.’ Froissart repeats this, v. 26, adding that
he had it from the cardinal’s attendants.
