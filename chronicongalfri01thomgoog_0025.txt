death and that of his mother-in-law are recorded; and we have also
the medical case os his widow‚ wh0, as mother of king Henry the
fourth’s late wife, Mary Bohun, is attended by the royal physician in
1408. From the fact of this case being entered in the MS„ and from
the character os the other additions, it seems not improbable that the
volume became the property of the physician of the family. But there
is also evidence os a still earlier link between the MS. and the BohunS,
dating back to the time of its compilation. For Thomas de Walmes-
ford, in whose favour the award was made, as recorded in article 9
which forms a part os the original contents, was in 1328 presented to
the rectory of Shenfield in Essex, and again in 1334 to the rectory of
Lees Magna or Much Lees in the same county, by John de Bohun,
earl of Hereford, who died in 1335. Walmesford then, was evidently
a dependent, in some way, os the family, and is, as seems not improb-
able, the MS. was originally compiled for him, it is no matter for
surprise that he should have included in it a chronicle written by one
