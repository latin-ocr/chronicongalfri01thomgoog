Rolls SerieS, iii. 215). In his letter to the bishop of Worcester the prince says that
he began the campaign on the eve of the Translation of saint Thomas of Canter-
bury, that is, on the 6th July. Baker begins with the prince’s arrival at Bergerac,
which he entered on the 4th August. Marching almost due north, his object
being to join hands with the duke os Lancaster, who commanded in Brittany, he
reached Argenton on the 21st, Chateauroux on the 23rd, and Vierzon on the 28th
os the month. The combat with Philippe (called Grismouton) de Chambly took
place on the latter day: ‘ Eodem die dominus Johannes Chaundos et dominus
Jacobus de Audele . . . . fecerunt equitatum cum ducentis hominibus et obvia-
verunt uni Franco nomine Gris Motoun qui secum habuit iiijxx lanceas, qui omnes
fugarunt et occisi suerunt3 capti tamen suerunt xviij. milites et armigeri. Angli
enim habebant x. lanceas tantum; le Gris Motoun primus suit qui sugam fecit!—

Pago 141, l. 1. Processerunt versus Romorengyn. Romorantin was reached on the
3oth August and was captured next day, and the outworks of the castle were
taken3 but Amauri de Craon and Boucicaut held the keep until the 3rd Septem-
ber, when it was set on fire, and they, ‘ quod non possent bene ignem extinguere
cum vino et aqua, quod in parva quantitate habebant intra se,' were forced to
surrender. ‘

—— 1. 29. Nunciantes quod coronatus Francorum, etc. King John was at Meurig-
sur-Loire, below Orleans, on the 9th September, and no doubt crossed the river at
Blois on the following day.—Froissart, ed. Luce, v. iv.

Pago 143, l. 7. Princeps vero Ltherim sequens. The exact course os the prince of
Wales’s march immediately aster leaving Romorantin is uncertain. Baker repre-
sents him as following the course of the Loire to the westward (‘ orientem' is a
blunder for ‘ occidentem ⁹) direct to Tours, before which he sat down for four days»,
and thence rose in pursuit of the F rench who had crossed the river behind his
back at Blois. The prince's own account agrees with this : ‘ Et illeosqes estoions
certifiez qe touz les pontz sur Leyre estoient debruses et qe nulle part purriens

‚ avoir passage; sur qei nous prismes nostre chemyn tout droit a Tours et la de·
mourasmes devant la ville quatre jours ’ (letter to the corporation os London).
Burghersh also states that ‘ le prince demorra devaunt le dit cite de Tours .....
par iiij. joures.’ The Eulogium, aster describing obscurely the march of the 5th
and 6th September, goes on to say: ‘ die Mercurii [7th Sept.] venit princeps ad
Aumonk super Leir juxta Tours in Turonia ..... ibi moratus est per dies jovis,
VeneriS, et Sabbati.' This place has been taken to be Chaumont. But this is
impossible, for Chaumont lies on the river not far below Blois, and very far away
from Tours. ‘ Aumonk ' must have been some place near the latter city, possibly
Amboise. Le Bel, ii. 196, may also be quoted : ‘ Puis ardirent les Angles la ville
de Remorentin et s'en vinrent parmi celluy pays qu’on clame Salongne, par devers
la riviere de Loyre; mais quant ilz entendirent que le roy Jehan estoit a BloyS, ils
sceurent bien que par la ilz ne purroient passer; si s’adreschierent par devers
Amboise, et le roy Jehan ala a l'encontre d'eulx par devers la cite de Tours; et
