x PREFACE.

the result of a natural interest in the great family of the neighbour-
hood is, 1 think, to some extent proved by the fact that the Bodley
MS„ to be presently described, in which is included Baker's chronicle‚
certainly belonged at an early date to some one closely connected
with the Bohun family.

But while Baker’s debt to de la More for material for his chronicle
may have been over-estimated, the extent to which he borrowed from
the work of Adam Murimutb, who was also probably a native of his
county and a near neighbour, is very liberal. A family bearing the
name of Murimuth appears to have been settled early in the fourteenth
century at Fifield, five miles north-west of Swinbrook; and assuming,
as we fairly may, that Adam belonged to it, we have at once the
explanation of neighbourhood for the adoption by Baker of the other's
work as the basis for the greater part of his own. We may, indeed,
be pretty sure that the two men were acquainted‚ though Murimuth
was the senior by some years, He appears to have died in ¹347 in
his seventy·second year; Baker was certainly living as late as 1358.
Murimuth's chronicle passed through at least three editions. lt was
with the second edition, brought down to the year 1341, that Baker
appears to have been acquainted. Although in some passages he
copies his contemporary word for word, more generally he is content to
follow the thread of the narrative, altering or amplifying the language;
but he also makes very important additions, for which lie obtained most
of his information from living sources. lt is, of course, these addi·
tions which give Baker's chronicle its historical value. For his know·
ledge of a part of the closing scene of Edward the second's reign he
was indebted, as we have seen. to sir Thomas de la More; and, as his
authority for details of the persecution of the unhappy king by his
brutal keepers, he quotes by name one of the ruffiam, William Bishop,
who lived long enough to repent his wickedness and tell the pitiable
story. And, in the course of both reigns, his descriptions of cam·
paigns and battles are certainly founded upon information imparted
